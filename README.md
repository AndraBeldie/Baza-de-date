docholden	1.0 out of 5 stars	October 28, 2018	Kindle Edition	Too unrealistic to enjoy	I was very disappointed in this book after reading all the hype about it. While the reading is good, the story is so nonsensical- a 6 year old left alone in a shack raises herself, living in the same shack, using the same boat, and no one lifts a hand to help her? In more than 20 years, the boat never breaks down, the house doesn't need repairs and she's able to wear the same clothes for many years....she's got long hair that she says is ratty and tangled but description s of it has it down her back, luxurious...she's gorgeous but bathing is optional until in her 20s...she has sex with a philanderer but never gets a vd and not once apparently does she get sick. No flu, cold, nothing....she never got shots and apparently has the immune system of a super hero because she stepped on a nail and never got tetanus....I kept reading so I'd finish and the ending is unexpected but it's generally a boring book where day after day, she's alone in the marsh....	3,668 people found this helpful
Don Meyers	1.0 out of 5 stars	October 1, 2018	Hardcover	Did I read the same book as others?	About half this book was good. Beautifully written at times, and with an interesting, plausible story. But wait...the gaps  ...Maybe less time talking about Kya fumbling around with sex with Chase and more time on her development as a renowned author and painter would have been nice. There's more, but you may be reading the book. I must comment though on the most ridiculous court room antics since  Curly's trial in a Three Stooges short.  Oh, I think I just did. (And just after reading a book on Harper Lee - if you know what I mean). This was one of the most disappointing books I have read in quite a long time. Sorry Ms. Witherspoon. Can I get my money back if I return the book?	1,531 people found this helpful
Lou	1.0 out of 5 stars	January 27, 2019	Hardcover	Most irritating book I've read in a long time!	I was sure I would like this book..and actually finished it.  I grew more irritated with each page by the last half.  I grew up in coastal North Carolina and was born in the 40s, so would be the same age as the main characters.  It was clear that the author did not do her research about the area and about what would be plausible at the time of the story. When she mentioned real towns, she should have known Asheville would not be the destination city from the coast, especially in the 60s.  Ma's old cardboard suitcase that had been in the closet in the marsh for 19 years would be covered in mildew,  Fireflies would have been called lightening bugs. No boy in a small town in NC would have been named either Tate or Chase in 40s, more recent popular names.  I could go on and on.  The inconsistencies in the dialect was grating, and many parts of the story were just not believable to me.  I am amazed that so many people loved the book and the poetry.	1,032 people found this helpful
rickeitt	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 19, 2018	Kindle Edition	This is the one - this is THE book you cannot put down	This is one of the most moving, caring, emotional novels I have ever read.  I read this book only because I had met Delia and have read her wildlife books she wrote with husband Mark Owens.  After starting the book this was all I could think about for days.  Kya's life become part of mine and the characters ceased to live on the page... they were alive with me and I was in the marsh, feeling every feather - the air, creatures and the plants.  Jumpin' became a trusted friend and so many moments touched my very soul.  I should not have been surprised as Delia has a great style in her wildlife books that I love to read.  But a novel like this is not my normal read.  Maybe I need to now reconsider what I choose as this book stopped me cold and made me rethink a lot that happened in my life.  Delia touched the human soul with her behavioral descriptions.  She is not only a respected wildlife scientist, she is a human behaviorist and understands more about the human condition that just about anyone else I know.  This is a tremendous treasure of a book and I'm sure it's staying in my read again list for a long time.  Highly recommend the book.	1,274 people found this helpful
Debbie	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 3, 2018	Kindle Edition	Take your time and savor every sentence.	I am extremely stingy with my compliments for good books, but this tale is well-deserving of the praise. Of the last dozen or so books I've read, only two others earned five complete stars by me: She Read to Us in the Late Afternoons: A Life in Novels by Kathleen Hill, and Circe by Madeline Miller.I have to confess that I have also had magical moments with marsh creatures such as herons, eagles, and mud turtles. Like the main character, Kya, I am a compulsive collector of treasures from those Great Rock Tumblers: the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean which makes this book so attractive to me. However, Delia Owens' writing is more than just about the natural world. She spins a good and very well-written tale about murder, courtroom drama, nature, poetry, and even love.Another reviewer described Owens' writing as lyrical. It is. Take your time and savor every sentence.	942 people found this helpful
Diane Parker	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 31, 2019	Kindle Edition	You'll NEVER Want To Leave	I read a lot. Sometimes folks refer a title to me ... sometimes I don't ALWAYS 'adjust' to the referring individuals taste. My niece recommended this title and said, "It's not so much the story line ... even though that's VERY good ... but, the WRITING style. After the first pages, I was HOOKED. Love Ms. Owen's style. Descriptive, picturesque speech.	790 people found this helpful
Emily O	2.0 out of 5 stars	September 16, 2018	Kindle Edition	Disappointing	This book had so many fantastic reviews. I was looking forward to reading it but quickly became disillusioned. I'm from NC and have never heard anyone talk with the type of accents Ms. Owens chose for her characters. It seems like a small thing but it was extremely distracting, and eventually became ridiculous, especially because the characters somehow switched back and forth between speaking like Mark Twain's Jim to perfect English. It made me wonder if the author has ever been to our fair state. The story was good enough, albeit predictable, and it's obvious the author did her research on marsh life. I learned quite a few wildlife facts that were interesting. The conversations just kept me wrinkling up my nose with distaste and I ended the book on a sour note.	1,075 people found this helpful
P Wilson	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 25, 2018	Hardcover	A moving story about survival in a way that most of us can't imagine.	Wow! I just finished reading Where the Crawdads Sing. And I will say it again, Wow! This books is so filled with emotion. Kya, the main character, is trying to survive by herself from a young age. She has been abandoned by those who should teach her, guide her, protect her. She has to fend for herself.  Two men come into her life and teach her about the good and bad in life. I only keep few book's that I know I will read again. This is staying in my library.	750 people found this helpful
island reader	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 29, 2018	Kindle Edition	OMG Wonderful Wonderful!	My favorite book of the year by far.  So beautifully written.  No skimming over sections in this book.  I devoured every single word.  I laughed, I cried (a lot) and most importantly thought differently about life - mine and everyone else's.  I became the character of Kya, desperately alone and forced to try to eke out an existence on her own in the marshes.  The marshes are their own separate character, but despite the fact that I am freaked out by insects and mud and most other creepy crawlies, I could actually imagine myself enjoying the Carolina experience, hard as it was.  You will root for Kya, I did, sometimes shouting out loud- You Go Girl!!!!!  I read this book in one day and can't stop thinking about it.  There are several clues to the surprise ending if you pay attention to the details.  This is a KEEPER!	529 people found this helpful
Joy of Reading	1.0 out of 5 stars	December 30, 2018	Kindle Edition	Really? Not a thumbs up from me.	Can't read, no school, starved and all alone but learns to read and then studies Einstein, really? Left all alone her whole life but the towns 2 most eligible bachelors fall for her, a good guy and a bad boy, really? I'm definitely in the minority.	433 people found this helpful
Cariola	1.0 out of 5 stars	November 5, 2018	Kindle Edition	Overrated, Dull, Unbelievable, Trite	Wow, how can so many readers rave about this book? I thought it was just awful. It took me every minute of the two weeks I had it on loan to get to the end. I don't know why I stuck with it as it was painful every time I picked it up; maybe I was in the mood for masochism. So what's wrong with it? Well, for one thing, every page was screaming at me, "This is sad. So sad. SO SAD!!!" I have a strong bias against books that I feel are emotionally manipulating me. As soon as I started reading about The Marsh Girl, I was reminded of 'Beasts of the Southern Wild,' a wonderful story of a little girl living alone with her sick father in the swamps. Mother gone, dad drinks too much and frequently disappears, both try to avoid the bad, bad authorities, and both love the natural environment even though it causes hardships--but that's where the similarity ends. 'Where the Crawdads Sing' should hope to be a tenth as good (but it isn't). It also can't decide whether it is a coming of age story or a murder mystery; the chapters jump between telling the story of Kya's life and the investigation of a murder for which she is later tried. And those trial scenes were the absolute most hackneyed that I have ever read. Old Perry Mason scripts were better. Secondary character--with the exception of Jumpin', a black man who runs a tiny gas station/convenience store that serves boaters, and his wife Mabel, are total stereotypes. 1) Jordie, the helpful older brother who quickly disappears, leaving Kya alone with 2) the drunken, abusive dad who isn't all bad when he's sober. 3) The Good Boy, Tate, who becomes Kya's only friend, and 4) The Bad Boy, Chase, the seduce-and-abandon type. 5) The cocky police chief and 6) his cocky assistant and 7) the cocky prosecutor. As to the writing: I love nature as much as the next person, but the writing in the long, long, tedious, repetitive passages describing shells and sea gulls and bird feathers and fireflies were, in my opinion, just plain bad (but not as bad as the trial chapters).  And a really bad "surprise" ending.I could go on, but just--ugh.	413 people found this helpful

SRF	2.0 out of 5 stars	October 15, 2018	Kindle Edition	Most overrated book of the year	This is a romance novel masquerading as literary fiction.The plot becomes increasingly ludicrous as it progresses, and by the end it is laughable.The dialogue limps from cliche to cliche. The heavy-handed dialect is painful to read.Some good nature writing — that’s the only redeeming quality, and the reason why I am giving this two stars instead of one.The NYT should fire that reviewer.	316 people found this helpful
jan	1.0 out of 5 stars	December 3, 2018	Kindle Edition	Almost Wonderful	The base storyline for this book - girl grows up in swamp, has few friends, becomes an expert on swamp life, lives a productive, unusual life - is strong and would have been a fine story. But somewhere along the way the writer decided the story needed more spice, I guess, and added what was for me a story killer. Do a rewrite and take out Chase Andrews. He doesn't need to be there, and Kya gets to remain a remarkable woman instead of what she actually ends up being.	289 people found this helpful
Gothic	1.0 out of 5 stars	December 20, 2018	Hardcover	Promising start that tanked.	Looks like I'm in the minority here, but did not enjoy this book. OK, wait, yes, I enjoyed the beginning and thought this has promise!  Then, it just went down paths that caused me to go "meh".  I could go on an on, but the thing that just got me the most, was when grown up Kya would speak.  REALLY?  I'm supposed to believe this kid, who was taught to read by another kid, would speak that properly and in such complete sentences without even a contraction used?  Yeah, no.	280 people found this helpful

Kindle Customer	1.0 out of 5 stars	December 5, 2018	Kindle Edition	Very disappointing.	Not sure how this one received all the  five star reviews. Started out quite slowly, picked up briefly, then just became a very long slow tale that didn't bother explaining much of what we really going on with the characters and their circumstances. Ending was just so condensed compared with rest of book.	221 people found this helpful
WriterToo	2.0 out of 5 stars	October 22, 2018	Kindle Edition	I wanted to like it, but...	Based on the reviews, and the sample pages I previewed on my kindle, I really wanted to like this book. And some of the writing was beautiful, particularly descriptions of nature. But...this is not a compelling read. The plot is beyond belief in many aspects, about a child virtually raising herself from the age of five, then her learning proficiency in reading from lessons from another child a few times a week over a course of month, to the main character’s brother all of a sudden showing up after many years (in spite of his apparently living close by). There are many plot holes. For example, Kya drives an unlicensed boat around the swamp for many years. Even back in the 60’s, boats had to have an annual license. Another: we find at the end of the book that she’d received mail for many years after the reader is told that all that was ever in her mailbox was advertisements. There are several others. Many characters are stereotyped caricatures, and the dialogue was often contrived or predictable. Hard for me to understand how so many have given this five stars. Weak plot. One dimensional characters (other than Kya— but you have to suspend considerable disbelief to relate to her), and poorly written (and sometimes unnecessary) dialogue.	212 people found this helpful
CB Chef	1.0 out of 5 stars	December 1, 2018	Kindle Edition	A waste of money!	This is one of the worst books I've read in a long time.

Robin K	2.0 out of 5 stars	October 11, 2018	Kindle Edition	Frustrating Geography, Ecology, etc!	I grew up in a coastal community in Northeast Florida with precisely the type of landscape described so eloquently in this novel, so perhaps that’s why I am having a much more difficult time excusing the author’s blatant errors in correctly differentiating between salt and freshwater species! There are no craw dads in a salt marsh, nor will you ever catch a bream there or observe wildlife drinking the salt water from the shore. These inaccuracies combined with the bizarre dialect selected as representative of North Carolina made the reading experience surreal and even offensive. Without a doubt, the author painted pretty word pictures of this salt/fresh water marsh, but the inconsistencies were too much to overcome. The story line itself was also pretty lackluster, even ignoring its implausibility. More proof that you should stick with the adage “Write what you know”!	204 people found this helpful
Bridgett	3.0 out of 5 stars	November 29, 2018	Hardcover	Beautiful prose, but the story line is lacking...	I'm very torn.After reading the 27,000+ rave reviews, my expectations were sky high. That's never a good thing, but the truth is, although there were many things to love in this story, there were many things I found lacking.First, the prose was absolutely stunning and beautifully descriptive. The problem for me was, amazing descriptions don't wow me. Amazing stories do. And I'm not entirely sure this was an amazing story.Second, the characters, Kya included, never really came to life for me. They all seemed flat and uninspired. At its roots, this is nothing more than a "girl from the wrong side of the tracks" story. Think Pretty In Pink, but set in a coastal marsh.Third, so much of the story line was simply implausible. From the abandonment, to the lack of interest in this young girl, to the trial--especially the trial.  I can't say much without giving spoiling the book, but trust me, the trial is a farce.Fourth, the poetry throughout was incredibly annoying to me. I found myself skipping over those sections throughout the novel, for two reasons--I'm not a poetry fan, and this poetry (what I read of it) was pretty terrible.At the end of the day, it's a lovely novel...it simply didn't resonate with me. I recommend it for those who love nature, poetry, and vivid prose.3.25 stars	161 people found this helpful
Amazon Customer	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 5, 2018	Hardcover	One of the best books I have read	Let me start by saying that this is the first review I have ever given.  I am a voracious reader and have over 5,000 books in my library.  I read fiction, non fiction, political, bios, horror, true crime, and everything in between.  I saw this book recommended on some magazine publication review, do not remember which one.  The plot sounded like something I might be interested in with intrigue, mystery, murder, and love.  I will admit that the narration of nature in the swamp and marsh does get a little redundant but  if you get past that you will find a book with a narrative hard to put down. You will feel compassion for the main character like you may have never felt before.  This book brought me to tears at the end.  I  recommended it as  a "must read" .  I don't think you will walk away not remembering KYA for a long time.	170 people found this helpful
Jane C.	3.0 out of 5 stars	February 14, 2019	Kindle Edition	Not terrible, but unbelievable and unbelievably overrated	This was an entertaining read and as a beach read I might have given it four stars. But it's a little more ambitious than that, and there are significant flaws. For some the editor (was there one?) was probably more at fault than the author. The most glaring, constantly annoying issue was the dialogue. White characters in 1960s/70s small town NC speak in perfect modern English (80% of the time), black characters in a vernacular. It's laughably racist. There are other instances of sloppiness with details and lack of thought and research. Maybe no research. It is like the author has never been to NC. The time and place just aren't consistently established. Kya gets running water installed. What does that mean? She already had a well. That's running water. She certainly didn't get hooked up to a municipal water supply. Likewise electricity. The fix it man did what, exactly, to get electrical service to her shack? Bubba doesn’t just run miles of electrical wires through a marsh. You have to call the electric company. The local marina starts selling $3.50 espresso before women enter the local watering hole for the first time in history. The main character is so beautiful she attracts both of the most eligible men in town. Plausible for a teen, but by her twenties she’d probably have a unibrow and her teeth would be falling out. She is self educated to a university standard, but her mom didn’t teach her to read when she was six? She couldn’t spell dog at the age of seven? Really smart kids learn to read very fast. If mom painted watercolors, genius six year old would be reading. Well.I was shocked to learn the author is a naturalist. I would think that background would make her very unlikely to make these kinds of errors. A more significant flaw is the plausibility of Kya's circumstances as a child and adult. Also, Tate's years long disappearance - what the hell?I enjoyed the book, and would not discourage anyone from reading it if they were bored and looking for light entertainment, but I think it's overrated. Way, way overrated. Seeing some of the accolades this book has been given makes me think the whole publishing / literary review industry is crooked. This is NOT a “good” book. Period.	130 people found this helpful
JAMES W HUTCHINSON	3.0 out of 5 stars	April 21, 2019	Kindle Edition	Even in Fiction, Authenticity Counts	(Review is by my wife E.J.)SPOILER ALERT! Do not read this review if you don’t want to find out who killed Chase.I am giving this book 3 stars despite my own annoyance at all the errors in geography, history, and dialect. I understand the need for a willing suspension of disbelief, but this novel asks too much of the careful reader. I found some of the descriptions enjoyable, and I think the book has a place in the categories of “chick lit” and YA fiction. Some of the prose is good; some is awful. Teenage girls will find passages like this one swoon-worthy: “Then, as she whirled around, she bumped into Tate, who had stood, and they froze, staring into each other’s eyes. They stopped laughing. Tate took her shoulders, hesitated an instant, then kissed her lips, as the leaves rained and danced around them as silently as snow.” (p.124)Too often I had to put the book down and exclaim “What? That’s ridiculous!” Many aspects of the plot make no sense. Nor do some of the characterizations. Consider Kya. From age 6, she raises herself with almost no adult guidance. She is practically feral without access to health care, dental care, good nutrition or personal hygiene needs. Yet she grows up to be a strong, healthy woman who turns heads with her beauty and her “wasp-thin waist,” a brilliant observer of birds and a successful, self-taught artist. She is completely illiterate at age 14, yet in her first reading lesson with Tate, she learns the letters of the alphabet, memorizes all their sounds and reads her first sentence—not from a children’s book, but from a book of essays on nature. (p. 193) Anyone who has ever worked with a beginning reader knows this is impossible.The novel paints a Disneyesque picture of the salt marsh. Unlike the real N.C. coast, it’s never cold or harsh or dangerous for a little girl. The animals are almost friends and there are no mosquitos or snakes. Hurricane Hazel, which devastated the N.C. Coast in 1954, when Kya would have been around 8, did not destroy her shack. In fact, it apparently didn’t happen at all. The author is supposed to be an expert on animals, but even some of the animals are wrong. Seen from a boat: “Brilliant white herons and storks stood among water lilies and floating plants....” (p.176) White egrets, maybe, but white herons are rarely seen north of the Florida Keys. Wood storks (the only North American stork) were first recorded in N .C. In 2005 and sightings are still rare.When I read that Kya’s father was heading for Asheville to discuss his army disability, I thought “Why would he go there rather than somewhere closer?” Numerous references to Asheville follow as if it’s a nearby city. No one on the N.C. coast would think of going “over to Asheville” to buy a birthday present or pick up supplies as they do in the story. It’s a seven-hour trip today, but in the 1950s, there were no Interstate or divided highways, making it an all-day trip. Kya’s father tells her that his family was once very well off, living on a plantation near Asheville and growing tobacco and cotton until the weevils got the cotton. (p. 57) Didn’t the author do any fact checking? Cotton was never grown in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It isn’t the right climate. There’s plenty of cotton in North Carolina, but it’s almost all grown in the Coastal Plains with a little in the Piedmont. Kya’s father tells her how he was expected to become a lawyer and “live in a columned mansion.” (p. 106) If he grew up in a wealthy, educated family, where did he get his uncultivated speech patterns?The characters of Tate and Chase, Kya’s good-boy, bad-boy suitors are inconsistent (two unlikely names for small-town Carolina boys born in the 1940s). Tate grows very close to Kya and seems to love her and consider taking her with him, then decides “Nah, she’s not going to fit in.” Suddenly, he’s heartless and cruel? He turns his back and abandons her completely while he’s in college. Then Chase, the real cad, nurtures a close relationship with Kya for a year to earn enough of her trust to take her to bed. Could he really maintain such false tenderness for so long while making fun of her behind her back? And would he sentimentally wear the shell necklace she gave him, yet try to rape her when he catches her alone? It doesn’t add up.Kya herself is the most inconsistent character of all—a regular Keyser Soze in the end. Throughout the story she is gentle, reclusive, sensitive, hesitant, meek. Then we find at the end that she has plotted carefully to sneak back to Barkley Cove using two different disguises, planning bus schedules perfectly, luring Chase to the water tower late at night, overpowering and killing him, then covering her tracks and successfully feigning total innocence.I could go on here—there are many more points of absurdity. I know this book is a page turner for its huge number of fans, but I wouldn’t recommend it for the close reader who expects more authenticity.	117 people found this helpful
Laurie	1.0 out of 5 stars	March 4, 2019	Hardcover	So Disappointing!	I know!  Oh boy there are a lot of readers who will COMPLETELY disagree with this rating.  Many of my friends loved this book.  Let's begin with what I liked about this novel - the main character's connection to nature and the scientific facts presented throughout the story.Now for the novel's downfalls...SPOILER ALERT!This story is just too improbable.  From Kya raising herself beginning at a very young age, to EVERYONE leaving her, to her killing someone it was all too much for me.  Kya never got sick or badly injured, needed a doctor, dentist?  This strong character goes to school for one day and is bullied away?  She had a wonderful relationship with her brother Jody, who then leaves her and never contacts her again for years.  He left her to live in a dilapidated shack ,with an abusive, irresponsible, neglectful  father.  That is not something this character would have done.  Next, Tate befriends her and presumably loves her.  He knows everyone has left her and he does also.  How could you do that to someone you love?  Neither character has a reasonable excuse for not contacting her in any way for years.Overall, the author used too much drama to develop the character she was trying to create.  Owens needs to show that she believes in the intelligence of her readers and not author-splain constantly.  Yikes!  I did not like this one.	119 people found this helpful
Cheryl	1.0 out of 5 stars	October 23, 2018	Hardcover	Waste of time	I have this book from Audible. At first I found the reader annoying. Then I realized that it was not just the reader it was the entire story. It was totally unbelievable- a child whose entire family abandons her to live in the marsh alone? The county welfare agents know this but but do nothing about it? Asheville is closet big city to the coast? The child learns to read, write, paint, all on her own? None of the characters are developed. None of them are likable. I cannot believe the reviews this book is getting. I’m glad Audible will take back books you don’t like because after listening to more than half I’m going to have them delete it from my listening library. I don’t want to waste anymore time listening to this predictable drivel. For the excellently written account of a child who taught herself, read the memoir, “Educated.”	150 people found this helpful

ReaderK	4.0 out of 5 stars	November 19, 2018	Kindle Edition	Must Suspend Reality A Little Too Much	First of all, I'll tell you what I loved about the book. I loved the writing--the way the author put words together creating a beautiful scene. She is very talented and has a wonderful, lilting, poetic, picturesque way about her prose. I enjoyed it. I also liked her main story idea of this young girl being abandoned out in the marsh, but learns to survive on her own. I believe someone like her could be a 'scientist' of sorts. I imagine someone like her could find and accurately categorize the wildlife, flora, and fauna of the place that is her whole world. But, her rise in the 'academic world' just wasn't believable. Very intriguing idea, but not convincing. Maybe I'm just a little too much of a realist to completely lose myself in that aspect of the story. Perhaps if the author would have described some 'hardships' other than extreme loneliness (and at first hunger).  Everything on the marsh was just so romantic and beautiful. What about the reality of living on the marsh? The bugs in the food, the idea of using the woods for nature calls esp. during that time of the month, or when you've got food poisoning from no refrigeration, or catch a cold, or suffer from numerous insect bites making your skin look terrible from excessive scratching, or what happens if you cut yourself, break a bone or need antibiotics? What person escapes childhood (even with lots of adults around) without any sickness or injury requiring adult intervention? Everything was just too beautiful--almost Disney-fied. Nothing (but humans) can hurt you in the marsh...yeah right. And the fact that she was just so beautiful and irresistible was also just a bit unbelievable.  We're talking about someone who isn't going to have the best hygiene, wouldn't have shaved her legs or armpits, no visits to the dentist, no floss, etc. etc. Her hair was long, beautiful, flowing...all the time without any products or seeing a professional. Marsh life would be tough on hair I would imagine. Yeah, all right, you could say all these miraculous beauty secrets COULD happen with some kind of natural remedies, but I have big doubts. I'm just saying some of the 'she is like a beautiful fairy with flowers intertwined in her luscious hair; her clear, unbitten, unblemished, flawless skin, and a perfect figure'...bothered me. Yes, she could be naturally beautiful, but what about every day hardships? Maybe throw in a few realistic aspects of living in the wild. Just watching Survivor would show you how people really look after time in the wild. Some of it ain't pretty. So, the Marsh girl is beautiful and smarter than anyone could imagine...almost everyone misjudges her. That whole theme went a little overboard in my opinion. And the conversations that she had with her love interests...unbelievably boring. I kept listening for some sign that there was all that intellect hidden under that Disney princess hair, but if you judge her on her dialogue alone? Yawn. Also, when the author has the main character reading poetry...I always picture the writer thinking, "filler...I need filler..."  A little bit is fine, but too much becomes distracting IMO.  Overall, despite my somewhat critical review, I enjoyed this book enough to give it four stars. I just thought a little too much suspension of belief distracted me from the story. Others may not find the Gorgeous-Nymph-in-a-boat in a magical marsh where she's friends with all creatures-fairytale as unbelievable or irritating as I  did.  But, still it was an entertaining read and that is usually what I judge books on. All in all, the author has a beautiful way with words and I would recommend this book.	110 people found this helpful
Avid Reader	2.0 out of 5 stars	October 11, 2018	Kindle Edition	Ending ruin a great book	I just finished binge reading this book. I shed many tears at the love of humanity throughout the book that kept the difficult life of the Marsh Girl from being absolutely tragic. Even the ending was perfect....or so I thought. The final ending ruined the entire book. I went from tears to dry-eyed disgust that such a beautifully written story was absolutely ruined.  I went from not being able to wait to let everyone know not to miss this book... to wanting to tell everyone do not read!  It is interesting how the end of a book can totally destroy the fine story, and this one certainly does. The ending does not, in any way, represent the character of the Marsh Girl that was so carefully crafted.  Too, too, too bad to ruin a great story.	113 people found this helpful
Amazon Customer	1.0 out of 5 stars	December 28, 2018	Hardcover	Insult to NC	As a native North Carolinian, this book griped me on a number of levels. First off, the drawl is insulting. We don’t talk like that. Even the uneducated hicks don’t. If her parents were well to do, they wouldn’t revert to backwoods mush mouth because of where they lived. Second, NO ONE from the coast goes to Asheville like it’s a normal thing. I live in the middle of the state. Asheville is 3-4 hours west of me. The outer banks are 5is hours from me. Driving from the coast to Asheville is an 8+ hour trip!! They’d go to Wilmington, Greenville, Rocky Mount, Raleigh. The concept of a 7 year old surviving on her own is far fetched enough, she never gets sick or hurt, can cook and clean up after herself, the shack never needs repairing, etc.  But more importantly, HURRICANES!! NC gets hurricanes! Hurricane Hazel hit NC in 1954, and was completely left out of the book. Came right in off the coast, like most hurricanes do. The shack would have been destroyed. Three: the swampy parts of NC aren’t on the coast. There much more inland. You get to swamp about 100 miles before the coast and swamp doesn’t peter out to the ocean.  There are pumas, cottonmouths, poisonous spiders, alligators, bears in that part of the state, but she makes it fine. Wrong geography, predictable, unbelievable story. Don’t waste your time.	127 people found this helpful
urbanite	1.0 out of 5 stars	November 25, 2018	Hardcover	Seems very inaccurate.	Being from NC, this book had me very confused. Geographically, I cannot think of a place in NC that exists like her fictional Marsh. Yes, marshes like this exist, but not next to the coast. And if the lead character, Kya, loves nature so much and documents every little detail about every little species... then where are the turtles, snakes (including poisonous ones), and alligators? The contrived accents she gave her characters were inconsistent, and every now and then completely abandoned. Although I must say, that her dialogue was better when she was at least trying to give them an accent. The rest of the time the dialogue was often rather trite and like a middle-schooler trying to write it. And why would Kya's parents, coming from wealthy families, all of sudden speak like rural swamp dwellers upon arrival? It makes no sense. And NO ONE, from coastal NC has EVER gone to Asheville, NC for supplies, or bureaucratic paperwork. Especially not in the 1950's and 60's. I wish the author had gotten the details right, it would have let me try to enjoy the story a little more. Instead, all of it just came across as completely unbelievable.	128 people found this helpful
Olga Gamer	3.0 out of 5 stars	October 24, 2018	Hardcover	This was not a "must-read" for me.	Unpopular opinion: I did not love this novel like many others did and perhaps the hype worked against it for me. "Where the Crawdads Sing" is the story of a young girl, Kya Clark, abandoned by nearly everyone: her family, her community, the school system. Throughout it all, she's managed to survive and piece together a meaningful life for herself filled with nature and the marsh she resides in. The readers get the chance to grow with Kya, the writer chronicling her journey as a young girl to her older age. The second story happening in the book is the unraveling of a murder and whether or not Kya played a role in it.There are certain parts throughout the book where I had to suspend my disbelief in order to power through the story. One of which was the high school quarterback interested in Kya as was Tate, a man who left for college but was haunted by memories and desires of his time with her. Perhaps this is me but realistically, I couldn't imagine either of those things happening based on Kya's interactions with either man. There was also no female bonding, just Kya being surrounded by them to offer her a helping hand. Both individuals seemed written to type, the classic good guy/bad guy scenario, which made the decision-making process in the love triangle relatively easy. I also thought that the pacing in the novel slowed down the story for me, as did the nature descriptions and many outdoors scenes where Kya is alone, inspecting the marsh. Though beautifully written, I never felt like those scenes moved the story along. It felt unnecessary to me.I don't want to reveal spoilers about the end but I rolled my eyes at some of the reveals. It was too coincidental.	102 people found this helpful
Ken Moore	1.0 out of 5 stars	January 2, 2019	Kindle Edition	Puhleeze!	It pains me mightily to read some of these five star reviews. This book is at best an average first novel, and at worst a copycat’s primer. It has been done before, better, by several writers. The characters are pretty used up by the many who came before. All of them. If this is where we have arrived in our appreciation of literature, maybe we need to start over.	98 people found this helpful

Sonpoppie	2.0 out of 5 stars	January 8, 2019	Kindle Edition	Improbable, unlikely, unbelievable.	Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia OwensImprobable, unlikely, unbelievable. There so many holes in the plot and in the writing that it falls apart in the first quarter. After an awful, neglected childhood, Kya survives taking care of herself from a very young age, finds a young man, Tate, who not only rescues her but teaches her to read, love poetry, and introduces her to university-level books. She’s Eve in paradise, a wild girl-child to be rescued, Pygmalion to Tate, educated and formed by him. He is even on hand to teach her about “becoming a woman“. All the time she remains isolated from all others and has no money except what she earns by scraping together pennies from selling mussels and fish. Unbelievable that a girl survives alone in the swamps, unbelievable she’s never seen, never caught by a person who would do her harm, yet she reads, recites poetry and feeds herself. There’s no description of how she earns money as she grows besides selling mussels and fish in her early years. There’s no indication that she uses her learned knowledge to lift herself out of the swamps and improve her life, earn a keep. There are many things that just don’t gel — the parents who are fairly middle-class, doing well until the depression where they lose all, move to the swamps where the father turns into the cliched drunk loser speaking swamp patois while the mother remains elegant, painting watercolours, hiding Easter eggs in the garden. There’s terminology that would have not been used or even known in 1965/69.  Poetry is littered throughout the text (some very bad poetry that’s easy to identify as the author’s). It would have been much more authentic if there was local Appalachian stories, songs, ditties and lore.	84 people found this helpful

Elizabeth Barry	1.0 out of 5 stars	April 12, 2019	Kindle Edition	A romance novel that is pure kitsch	Our book club selected this book, so I read it.  I do not recommend it unless you like books that pander to women's fantasies of being "wild and free" but also married to a protective, perfect mensch of a man.  Some parts of it are well-written, but the "dialect" writing is cringe-producing.  It's clear that the author has never heard a real Southerner speak:  she sort of fused Appalachian dialect with low-country dialect in a way that makes no sense and is a bit insulting to Southerners of all races.It has to be noted that the murder mystery at the heart of the book does keep the plot moving. But the plot is also pretty predictable and has the usual structure of a romance novel:  girl meets boy in childhood; falls in love with boy as a teen; boy leaves girl; girl meets bad boy; good boy comes back; then girl has to choose between "sensible" relationship with stable good boy or wild, irrational relationship with sexy bad boy.  If you like this sort of thing, just buy a bodice ripper!  Also it goes without saying that the protagonist girl is of course beautiful and even gorgeous, although she grew up alone eating only grits for years, not a recipe for the body beautiful.Other reviewers have noticed the lack of plausibility in the plot: that a girl child could survive in a swamp alone at age seven, then learn to read and become a kind of biology savant.  But this is part of the fantasy!  You can be wild and free like Pippi Longstocking with no parents, but also literate and even make money writing!  And never have a job or kids, and be married to a really great guy!It bothers me that this book was a best-seller.  While one in four Norwegians read "My STruggle" by Karl Ove Knausgaard, a book that counts as real literature, we Americans are reading what is essentially sexy Young Adult Fiction. We can do better.	76 people found this helpful

User	2.0 out of 5 stars	March 5, 2019	Kindle Edition	Stunningly bad	I have no idea what book these other people read, the one I received was a slog to get through, poorly structured and derivative: a veritable Frankenstein's Monster, patched together from best sellers of the last few years. The first third is essentially a modern Clan of the Cave Bear: plucky little girl implausibly survives in the wilderness all on her lonesome-- and ends up a little shy but otherwise suffers no ill effects from having no contact with other people for weeks at a time. The middle section is pure Charlotte Simmons-- impossibly brilliant, impossibly beautiful and angelic teen trusts the wrong men-- and the final is a third rate murder mystery with a surprise ending borrowed from... well, I'd best not say: it is the only thing that (almost) redeems an otherwise forgettable novel. But it main mystery solves is  why the reader has been subjected to SO MUCH bad poetry.	66 people found this helpful

I am a native North Carolinian and where this author got some of her ideas is beyond me.  I wonder what she was smoking or drinking while writing this.

K. Lewis	1.0 out of 5 stars	March 22, 2019	Hardcover	Painful to read if you're from North Carolina	First novels don't have to be steeped in research, but why write about a real state if you're not even going to look at a map? It felt as though the author assumed no one who reads has actually ever been in North Carolina, and I'm pretty sure she herself has not.  It is a plot point in several places that various characters, who supposedly live on the Outer Banks, "run to Asheville" for supplies.  On today's roads, that is over an eight hour trip.  There are myriad towns and cities along the way.  No one, ever, would "run to Asheville" from the coast to buy a bike or supplies for their boat.  It would take less time to travel there from Baltimore, MD.  This, with other breaks from reality, such as no hurricanes affecting the lay of marsh during the Marsh Girl's time there (a very active couple of decades for hurricanes in that area) and DNA being standard college curriculum in the early 1960's; plus the ridiculous way in which the characters speak, bearing no resemblance to what is a very distinct regional accent, made for a painful read.  I can't even comment on the story itself, as I was so distracted by the author's ignorance.  Maybe if you live far away, and these little details mean nothing to you, it could be an enjoyable read.	64 people found this helpful

megustaleer C	1.0 out of 5 stars	April 2, 2019	Kindle Edition	Distracting Inaccuracies	I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did, but as the inaccuracies piled up, I found myself getting distracted from the story. First off, the setting. I am from North Carolina and don't recognize anything about the author's descriptions. Where is this marsh/swamp? Why are there BEARS there? Why in the world would people from the coast drive clear across the state to Ashville just to buy a bike? Why does the author describe loads of historic buildings in an area that gets regularly slammed by hurricanes? Why did she choose to give all of her characters absurd accents that read nothing like a real eastern NC accent (which is distinctive)? Why did she have them go barefoot in winter without mentioning that it gets dang COLD in the winter? It was clear from page one that the author knows next to nothing about North Carolina, its people, its wildlife or its history. So why set the story there? Why even bother to make it a real place, or to presumably teach us about its habitats and wildlife?Authors invent, and that's fine. I don't need every single novel to be packed with research and facts. BUT... this book in particular was billed as part field guide to NC.  Several reviews in the mainstream press talk about the author's obvious connection to the land, about how intimately she knows the place. Ummm...... no.Really, this irks me so much because, as a North Carolinian who hasn't lived in NC for 20 years, I meet people all the time who have a gross misunderstanding about the south.  For some, anything Virginia and below seems one big redneck wasteland where the people, culture, and lack of education are all the same. It's sometimes shocking to me just how many people from other parts of the country hold on to a stereotype that has no bearing on anything I see when I go back to North Carolina. And this book plays into those stereotypes. It treats NC as though it were a sampling of South Carolina (where the real 'Low Country' is), Georgia and Louisiana. It surprised me that the editorial team didn't care about or realize how many errors there are. Did they really think there are bears on the beaches of NC? Did they forget about hurricane season? Did they not even glance at a map? Add to that the many, many professional writers who reviewed this book and caught NONE of these glaring factual errors. Then thousands upon thousands of people gave this book 4 and 5 stars and didn't seem to be bothered by these details either. I don't get it.The merit of the novel itself is debatable, but honestly, I couldn't even concentrate on whether or not Kya's story was believable, on whether her motives made sense, or on how the plot unfolded because I was continually annoyed at the misrepresentation (wilful or ignorant) of a place I love.	60 people found this helpful
rc	1.0 out of 5 stars	February 9, 2019	Hardcover	More Crawdads and Less Silly Plot	I agree with others who deemed this novel a one star. It certainly begins promising but the soap-opera plot that gains ridiculous momentum was exasperating.  The naturalistic exposition was great but the characters were not believable. In fact, they were a circus act. I am irritated by authors who monetarily benefit from a good beginning, and then turn on you midway through and leave you feeling stupid for having purchased the novel. I won't be fooled again by this author.	57 people found this helpful
leeharrison	3.0 out of 5 stars	January 26, 2019	Kindle Edition	Maybe I'm Too Old?	It was nearly impossible for me to suspend reality enough to enjoy this book.  Aside from the obvious perils of a 6-year-old raising herself in the wild, there was little in the way of character development--which is actually the only thing that made the ending even remotely plausible  The choice of Ashville as a destination city is bizarre...since it's a good six hours from the coast.  Wilmington,  Lumberton or New Bern would make more sense.  I know I'm in the minority on this which is why I assume I've just been around too long to buy into this kind of fantasy.	56 people found this helpful

Unable to read and without adults to establish a moral bearing, she creates her own spiritual beliefs and conforms her actions accordingly.

Susan	1.0 out of 5 stars	March 2, 2019	Kindle Edition	Nothing more than a coming-of-age story	I began reading the book several times and couldn’t get beyond the first chapter. Based on thousands of glowing reviews, I finally plunged ahead to the end. The story of Kya, the Marsh Girl, is an unrealistic coming-of-age tale that takes place in North Carolina marshland.I wanted to like this book; I tried to like this book. The story, despite its unique setting, is trite. Strip away the nature lessons and the amateur poetry (which I found distracting), and there is little but Kya and her travails. I have no issue with flights-of-fancy, but Kya’s story is realistic, bordering on the absurd. Try as I might, I cannot envision any five-year-old child cooking, cleaning, shopping, boating while having one-on-one conversations with every marsh denizen she encounters.I appreciated the prose until I didn’t. Speed reading became my friend as I struggled to reach the end. The dialogue annoyed me; where did those cornpone accents come from?Perhaps I’m too much of a realist. I wonder when the film version of this book will be announced. Maybe it will translate better to the big screen. I still wonder what I’m missing.	47 people found this helpful
Tam	2.0 out of 5 stars	November 9, 2018	Kindle Edition	Overrated.	Amazon recommended this to me after finishing Bastard Out of Carolina by Dorothy Allison, one of my favorite books, for what must be the hundredth time. It just doesn't compare. There is a lot of potential here, but it's largely unexplored. The character development is unsatisfying, and much of the story feels rushed. There are far too many convenient plot twists for my taste, and the use of dialect, especially by the black characters, gets hokey and grating after a while. The whole novel has the feel of a rough draft. Expanded, it might be better.	51 people found this helpful
P. Greer	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 19, 2018	Kindle Edition	Best book I've read in awhile!	I loved this book from the very first sentence to the very last sentence.The prologue begins in 1969 in the Marsh.  From the first few sentences describing it “Marsh is a space of light, where grass grows in water, and water flows into the sky” you are pulled into the wonderful descriptive writing.  But then we soon learn that we are being introduced to the Marsh through the discovery of a body, that of Chase Andrews.Then we are taken back to 1952.  Kya, six years old, watches her ma walking away from the house.  She is wearing her fake alligator skin high heels and carrying a blue train case.  Ma always turned around to wave when she reached the road, but this time she didn’t.  That was the last time Kya saw her mother.As her brothers and sisters leave one by one, Kya is left to fend for herself.  Sometimes her pa is around and sometimes he isn’t.  Kya learns to survive in the marsh.I can’t even begin to describe the life Kya leads, without giving anything away.  I don’t want there to be any spoilers because it unfolds so beautifully in the book.The story is everything, heartbreaking, heartwarming, lyrical, moving, tragic and uplifting.  I fell in love with Kya, her strength, her simple goodness.Highly recommend.I received an ARC of the book.	48 people found this helpful
ro	3.0 out of 5 stars	February 10, 2019	Hardcover	Unrealistic in so many ways	Where do I begin? This was an easy book to read, I finished it in a day. I have a hard time understanding how this can be a 87% 5-star rated book. The story is of a elementary school aged girl raising herself is next-level Hollywood, very Blue Lagoon. How did she get two guys so interested in her? What was the state of her hair, skin, nails, TEETH, HYGIENE, surviving on grits and mussels with no access to healthcare or basic necessities? I can see how someone could be self-taught but to be a certified genius who wrote award-winning scientific books? Oh man I really had to throw out all rational thinking to continue reading. Then the ending, how is this ending possible when for the last 350 pages we have been told how shy, how gentle, how innocent Kya is? Even in her interactions with Chase, in even her pursuit of his companionship, her personality seems to change from that she exhibits with others.Delia Owens writing of the environment of the marsh and it’s many creates really paints a picture, it is the real beauty of the book. The prejudice that Kya and Jumpin’ faced was realistic. Tate was a realistic character. If only Kya was more realistic, this book would have lived up to its 87% 5-star rating.	43 people found this helpful

warbler	4.0 out of 5 stars	October 23, 2018	Hardcover	Lovely Read for Those of Us Who Love Nature....But.....	Kya, abandoned, grows up alone in a shack in the coastal marsh of North Carolina. This is her story, one of love and mystery.Her marsh is located an hour and a half from Greenville. Yet when "Pa," drunk and carless, needs to seek advice from veterans affairs, he goes not to nearby Fayetteville, but to Asheville, some 350 miles away near the Tennessee border . Later, when a shopkeeper leaves town to stock up on supplies, he goes not to nearby Wilmington, or New Bern, or even Raleigh, but apparently makes a 700-mile round trip again to Asheville. Many read this manuscript, including an editor, and yet no one seems to have consulted a map of NC. This bizarre geographical ignorance mars an otherwise nicely written account of Kya's struggle with loneliness, isolation, and love. Still, a four-star, and overall a nice easy read.	41 people found this helpful

drinking tea with mittens on	1.0 out of 5 stars	March 29, 2019	Hardcover	i finally gave myself permission to stop reading this book	i had read and enjoyed two other books in the Reece's Picks, so i thought i would read this book. but, ugh. at first i was captivated by the book. the language was beckoning and i was presented with a character i wanted to care about. but then, what happened? i felt like i was being emotionally manipulated by the scenario of a young girl in an awful situation. and i tired of the sea and the shells and the feathers, even though nature is my thing. but really? the author made the case over and over again, move on. i also didn't like the way the book took us out of the 1950s to present us with a murder in the later 1960s. more manipulation. but still, i tried to read on. and the thing is, i read a lot. i have a stack of books at any time waiting for me to read. but i felt that i HAD to finish this book because of all the five star reviews. what was i missing? so i came to the amazon reviews and started reading some. i quickly realized it was okay to NOT finish this book. it was too predictable, too cloying, too purple, too unreal. the story i did like (loved!) is EDUCATED. now there is a book i can get behind. when i go home tonight, i'm going to take this book and place it in my donation pile for our local library. someone else will find it and love it. but not me.	34 people found this helpful

Cat.	3.0 out of 5 stars	February 11, 2019	Kindle Edition	Great book with one glaring problem--poor research	I liked this book and probably would have given it 5 stars for its examination of the themes of loneliness and abandonment, et cetera.  BUT, having spent my life on the coastal plains of Virginia and both Carolinas in the past 68 years, I became increasingly bothered by the author's  nearly total ignorance of her setting and that led me to wonder if the details of the marine life were also manipulated.  Simply put, the book is embellished with all sorts of environmental details which are just wrong.  Has the author ever visited the coast of North Carolina or even looked at a map???The first big error, repeated several times was geographic.  Asheville is a good 6 hour drive from anywhere on the coast of North Carolina.  Not even middle class locals would have traveled there to go to Sears or conduct any other business way out in the mountains.  The Low Country is in the southern half of South Carolina. Palmettos and Spanish moss may be found now and then in North Carolina but the landscape she described was pretty heavy on South Carolina  flora.  Then toward the end of the book, she described Kya's black friends not being allowed to wait with her white supporters in the courthouse or eat lunch with them in the restaurant.  The chapter heading was 1970.  Hello?  Civil Rights passed in 1964. No place that I know of in the rural South would have been able to get away with that!  These errors became such glaring distractions that it really hurt the book.  Isn't one of the first rules of writing that you should write what you know? Toward the end I decided that the writer had a story to tell and she wanted to set it in the small town South so she could play up the prejudice theme so badly that she didn't even visit the area to get her details straight.  Prejudice is and has been everywhere.  You don't need to manipulate your setting to make sure we get your point.  For someone writing a book about prejudice, I'd say her prejudice is showing.	35 people found this helpful

onc	1.0 out of 5 stars	September 4, 2018	Hardcover	Suffocating dullness throughout	My impulse is to temper this review because “Where The Crawdads Sing” is a first novel by a wildlife scientist who has had some success wirting about her career. But this fiction effort suffers from a weak plot, flat characters and an all but universal lack of emotional resonance. I was led to believe by early reviews that the book is centered on a sort of wild child growing up alone in coastal North Carolina, where I have lived for many years. I sense that there might have been a decent story in all this, but the book’s overriding dullness is too suffocating for anything decent to escape the swampy pull of its prosaic prose.	83 people found this helpful

Anyway nothing to miss here with this one	33 people found this helpful
J. M. Yowell	1.0 out of 5 stars	April 1, 2019	Kindle Edition	Nope.	Not sure what all the hype is about. I read this for my book club pick of the month. I did not attend the meeting because the story was so slow, I wasn't finished in time. The story is completely predictable and unrealistic. I had VERY strong feelings about her family, especially the mother, I couldn't get past. The book is VERY wordy, which to me felt heavy and probably why it was a slow read. I was ready for it to be over. If you think you can guess what is going to happen- you are correct. Asheville is in the mountains, not a town near the coast. The dialect wasn't natural for the area and wasn't consistent in the book. I can go on, but I will stop here. You can decide for yourself, but I would recommend getting it from the library and save some money.	30 people found this helpful
Diana M	3.0 out of 5 stars	October 28, 2018	Kindle Edition	Well written, but a downer	A well-written book, but what a downer. After reading about 40%, l just had to say, no more.  Nothing good is going to happen next to this poor  girl! Kya, when we first meet her is six years old and is living in a shackin the North Carolina marshland with her family. She is waving goodbye to her beloved mother who is leaving and not looking back, and leaving behing poor Kya and four older children and an abusive husband. The little girl fends for herself, though a few people look out for her. She learns phenomenal survival skills. There is also a storyline about a privileged young man who was murdered and whose broken body lies in the marsh. We meet him first as a child who careens around on his bicycle, barely missing pedestrians.The author does give us vivid and beautiful descriptions of the birds and other wildlife that inhabit the marsh. She is a gifted writer.But the story is unrelentingly sad and, at the point l stopped reading, seemingly with just more unhappy things to come.Because of this, l  would not recommend it.	33 people found this helpful
four Irish	3.0 out of 5 stars	November 7, 2018	Kindle Edition	Ending was Upsetting	Absolutely did not like the ending.

Rita S. Sims	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 23, 2019	Kindle Edition	I couldn't put this book down	I inhaled this book! It held my attention to the very end.The writing was excellently descriptive and I felt like I was there in theswamp, riding in the boat or seeing the wildlife with Kya.The brilliant author, Delia Owens, brought me back to the "who done it" mystery from time to time, but also kept filling me with background, history, sights and emotions until I felt I knew Kya and the other characters.The stark portrait of the struggles of this poor young girl and the cruelty of the upper class to this "swamp trash" child was heartbreaking. But I kept pulling for her, praying for others to see past the dirt and grime on her little face.It was a wonderful read!!	27 people found this helpful
Kindle Customer Richard E. Moore	4.0 out of 5 stars	January 18, 2019	Kindle Edition	Right Story, Wrong Time Frame	I loved the story.  I loved the portrayal of Kya's sense of loneliness, betrayal, abandonment, and isolation.  I loved the author's ability to make the marsh come alive with abundance of life in nature's nursery which is a tidal estuary.  I loved the way that the author infused each character with characteristics which made each one come alive for the reader. It was possible to feel the abhorrent treatment that caused a mother to walk away from her own children. It was possible for the reader to take part in Tate's self-flagellation for allowing his own personal goals to come between him and the love that he felt for Kya.  It was extremely easy to feel the hatred and animosity that Kya felt toward Chase.  What was not to love about the realistic portrayal of Jumpin' and Mabel and the unbreakable bond that formed between them and Kya.  The author made all of her characters relatable and believable. Probably not since Rocky have I cheered for the underdog. Anyone who has ever experienced a loss in his/her life will become totally absorbed into Kya's triumphs and traSgedies.  At the risk of putting a damper on the enjoyment of this book by future readers, I will now issue a spoiler alert.  With the abundance of acknowledgement s at the end of the book, someone should have been wise enough to put this story in the proper geographic and chronological perspective. There is no way that a Trailways bus can get from Greenville, NC to the Atlantic Ocean in one and a half hours. The is no where that the marsh runs headlong into the Atlantic Ocean--especially where a small runabout can leave the marsh and motor directly into the ocean. There are hundreds of varieties of marine life in a saltwater estuary, but the break that were caught and eaten in the book could not have lived in saltwater.  They are a freshwater sunfish.  The time frame of the book is a decade too late. Separate but equal segregated schools no longer existed. It was no longer legal for restaurants to refuse entry to women and blacks. No longer could courthouses require the "coloreds" to sit in the balcony. And finally, and most grievous of all, there is not a single town in the state of North Carolina that is surrounded by the Everglades.	26 people found this helpful
Curtis Lee Wilson Jr.	1.0 out of 5 stars	March 23, 2019	Hardcover	Dull and unoriginal	I read a lot, mostly historical fiction and romance/drama. This novel was highly recommended for my book club and I was very excited to read it. But I ended up horribly disappointed and I don't understand all the great reviews. I can tell this is the writer's first novel because her writing is so dull and flat. I didn't feel a connection to anything she described or between the characters. The story was incredibly boring up until the last 3 chapters then I was mildly surprised but the ending.This story line is also very similar to the story line of a book called Ruby by VC Andrews which makes me wonder if Owens is a fan and got her ideas from that book. The setting, time period, theme, and names are all too similar to be coincidence. I'll even go as far as saying Where the Crawdads Sing is a very water downed knockoff of Ruby because of how many similarities there are between the two books.If you like trendy books with no originality then you might like this but if you're a book snob like me and know what good writing is then I would pass on this book. I'm upset I had to spend the extra money on the hardcover copy.	27 people found this helpful

Mountain Girl	1.0 out of 5 stars	March 4, 2019	Kindle Edition	Very disappointing.  If you're looking for an uplifting read, pass this one by and look elsewhere.	How in the world did this book get a 5 star rating??  It is badly in need of a good editor.  It goes on . . . and on . . . and on, filled with a lot of superflous information that really doesn't contribute much to the story.  It is simply not believable.  I stayed with it until the end . . . and wished I hadn't.  So many people comment on this being an uplifting book.  I did not find it that way.  To me, it was very dark.  Sad to think that basically an entire community (save a few individuals) would turn its back on a young child abandoned and  left completely alone to fend for herself.  I believe that as a people, we are better than that and have compassion for others.  I've seen it operate many, many times in my life and career.  There are people in this world who still reach out to others in love . . . and had the author taken that approach, it could have been SUCH a powerful and beautiful story!!	26 people found this helpful
N8RMama	2.0 out of 5 stars	December 17, 2018	Kindle Edition	Unbelievable	Quite literally, this novel is unbelievable. The story is so thin it crumbles and I can't forgive for the sake of the rest. The characters are unbelievable too, especially the heroine, who says and does things that defy logic. The writing was bland; it reminded me of bad television not literature. I did like all the natural history and nature references. Maybe the author should stick to that.	27 people found this helpful
smore	2.0 out of 5 stars	February 6, 2019	Kindle Edition	Meh.  Why all the 5 star ratings?	This book is not worth your time.  I read it on an airplane not having other options.  The story is far fetched, and the plot is obvious.  Is it really possible for a girl to dwell in dangerous swamplands and be educated by a teen lover enough to become an author?  The mystery in this book is no mystery at all.  You know what's coming!  I'd say this is truly a mediocre book with a mediocre plot. There are so many better books out there!  One more thing, the book was poorly edited and full of sentence fragments.  If this type of thing is annoying to you, this book will make your head spin.	25 people found this helpful

LBF	1.0 out of 5 stars	July 18, 2019	Hardcover	"No!" the crawdads shreik; again- louder this time, "NOOOO!"	Take any pulp novel and you will discover it to be more well-written than this work of superficial insignificance. Every character of this novel is weak, unformed, and perhaps worst of all - entirely predictable; cardboard cut-outs. There is not a worthwhile bone in the body of this malnourished piece of rot. Starving girl zips around marshes and swamps in a motorboat that she has somehow, by age six, learned to navigate like a pro. Thus, the story drags on. The girl is eventually a woman in her twenties who has somehow survived entirely alone, save for the nice boy from town who taught her to read at university-text level. The chick very uneventfully loses her virginity to the town cad, who she has been dramatically resisting until the guy has blue-balls. I'm pretty sure that she's thirty by the time she "gives it up." Oh - and there's the absurd murder thing woven awkwardly into the story because crime story books are trending right now and because the book is too badly written to stand on its own without an attempt at diversion. (And what on earth dialect are the novel's characters speaking..."ya" and "you" and "y'arn" all in the same sentence?) Crawdads reminds me of one of those overly-priced trash novels you hurriedly purchase form an international airport book stand so you have something (anything) to read during the ten-hour flight before you. It's a darn shame that this novel wasn't authored by Alice Hoffman. A good, hardy blast of her magic realism could have redeemed this disagreeable waste. If Crawdads bespeaks of the contemporary state of literature - God help us.	20 people found this helpful

Artbart	3.0 out of 5 stars	January 3, 2019	Kindle Edition	Abandoned child lives in swamp	The beginning of the story, in which the child is abandoned by her family, is a gripping read. They live in the swamp, and the place is given life by the author's knowledge of the plants, animals, mud and water there. As the girl becomes a woman, her isolation makes her vulnerable to men, who also abandon her. Their characters are not as well developed, not as three dimensional. The last part of the story happens within the criminal justice system, and here the author is not honest with the reader about the incident in question. The law enforcement characters are also flat, and incompetent.	22 people found this helpful
Boo's Mom	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 23, 2018	Kindle Edition	A Rarity	It is only once in a blue moon that a novel captures me as this one did.  For me to write a review is also a rarity.  From the first paragraph to the last I was completely immersed in the plot, characters, and motifs.  The author's lyric voice sings clearly in the words of Kya, the main character.  Both heart and gut wrenching, I am profoundly affected by this novel and was pleased that the author gave us the complete story.  For most novels, I do find that I read a book, finish it, and then a few days later have difficulty remembering what the book was about.  I know that this novel will always be with me in mind and spirit.  I have and will heartily recommend this novel to my friends, family, and anyone else who loves to read.  I would say that if you read no other book this year, read Where the Crawdads Sing.	23 people found this helpful

I have never heard anyone talk with accents as in this book. Also, it is utterly ridiculous that Asheville is mentioned so often. It's a good 8 hr drive from the coast, in 2019 -- there's no way that Chase would have driven there for "supplies" for his store, in the 60s, without the highways of today, or that Tate's mom was driving there to buy him a bike. Raleigh, maybe, but Asheville, which was a little mountain town back then? No way. Ruined it for me. That, and it was a totally unbelievable plot.	19 people found this helpful

It’s a beautiful, incandescent story written with lyrical prose that weaves seamlessly from the past to the current time in which the story is set.

J. M.	1.0 out of 5 stars	April 28, 2019	Hardcover	Did the Author do any research	I live in North Carolina and only got to page 43 of this book before I commented to my daughter that I didn't think the author had ever been in North Carolina, and possibly didn't even look at a map of the state. My issues were many, and have been described very well by Lou and others who are from the North Carolina coast, and who also gave one star reviews. Even without the stereotypical speech that tries to pass for Southern and is nowhere near any of the rich coastal North Carolina dialects, and even without the fact that one of the characters goes to Asheville from the coast to "discuss some issues with the army", and even without the fact that along the Graveyard of the Atlantic, which the author mentions in setting the scene, you would not be able to walk directly to the ocean from the mainland as Kya does without having to swim across the Pamlico Sound and cross over one of the Outer Banks to the ocean, I would not want to waste another minute reading this book (even to find out how Crawdads manage to sing).	18 people found this helpful
Amazon Customer	3.0 out of 5 stars	March 13, 2019	Kindle Edition	Did we read the same book?	I picked up this book because of all the 5-star reviews, and haven't felt so "meh" about a book in a long time.  The character development is totally flat other than Kya, and although other negative reviews suggest that a young girl could not possibly live this way on her own, let's put that aside and assume Jumpin' and Mabel helped her more than the book credits.When Chase died, I wasn't angry, I wasn't happy, I didn't feel like he got his comeuppance, I felt like it was just words on a page.  Don't get me wrong, he did some bad things, but he wasn't developed enough for me to care about him, good or bad.Amazing books have amazing characters - many have likened this book to Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible, and I think that's an insult to Kingsolver.  The father in Bible was complex - both good and bad, wanting to do what was right for his god and his family, while the two needs conflicted.  I felt sorry for him.  I was happy for him.  I hated him.  This book offers none of that.	15 people found this helpful
Renne Newman	2.0 out of 5 stars	March 11, 2019	Kindle Edition	A Real Missed Opportunity	Where the Crawdads Sing was a major disappointment.  In terms of the story, there was much potential, but the characters were too stereotypical and two-dimensional.  As a lifetime resident of NC and specifically the NC coast, I was pleased with the focus on our wonderful flora and fauna. This was a fine nature guide. However, the author clearly did not research the people nor even geography of our wonderful state.  For example, when the term “lagoon” is used in eastern NC, the speaker is talking about a hog waste pond, not a natural body of water.  Why would someone drive to Asheville, an eight hour drive from the coast currently, to buy a bicycle even in the 1950’s when to get there you drive through major cities!  In the 1960’s, few women attended UNC Chapel Hill.  If the author had invested any time in learning about North Carolinians and our wonderful state, this book could have been excellent.  It clearly was not!	17 people found this helpful
bill greene	5.0 out of 5 stars	October 9, 2018	Hardcover	Mystery, romance, adventure, and nature pulled seamlessly together in this phenomenal story	Overall: an enthralling and highly descriptive story centered around a murder mystery with elements from science, romance, nature, and adventure. 4.5/5 or 8/9Note: would have been 9/9 and best book of the year up until the final chapter.  Some spoilers under “the bad.”The good: The writing of this novel is phenomenal. There are rich descriptions throughout that transport you to the scene and make you feel like you are actually there. There is tremendous character development throughout the entire story and focused primarily on Kia and Tate but on many of the other characters as well. The plot is fast paced and keeps you interested and engaged (or completely obsessed as I was) from beginning to end. Theme wise, this book has it all; mystery, romance, adventure, plot twists, and a lot about science and nature. This really would have been my favorite book of the year up until the final chapter.The bad (spoilers ahead): I hated the ending. I had heard there were major twists and turns which are all a positive, but then the ending almost ruined it for me. The major reasons: 1. It was abrupt. It felt like it needed either an epilogue or some more time at the end because the way I read it came across as extremely rushed. 2. The author added in way too many sad events (no children, two deaths, and then Kias early death) on top of the “big reveal” that it made it feel over the top, not believable, and once again, rushed. 3. “The big reveal” yes, I had suspected this character initially but after reading the whole novel i really was incredulous. My theory was it was going to be Kia and Tate together, or else Jumper, or even Chase’s wife. It really didn’t matter too much who it was but it was the process of how we got there which was one of the highlights of the book. The way the ending was felt out of place, did not make sense to me, and I felt so let down after having finished the last page. Despite that, still an amazing book that I would recommend highly.“I wadn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.”“What d'ya mean, where the crawdads sing? Ma used to say that." Kya remembered Ma always encouraging her to explore the marsh: "Go as far as you can --- way out yonder where the crawdads sing."Tate said, "Just means far in the bush where critters are wild, still behaving like critters.”“There are some who can live without wild things and some who cannot.”	16 people found this helpful
Nocturnal	3.0 out of 5 stars	January 15, 2019	Kindle Edition	Not one of those deep books that makes you think	It's just one of those kinds of books you read in one afternoon when it's pouring rain outside and you don't want to go and get wet, you stay inside in front of the heater and just read.

The book is a bore. There are pages and pages of description of the marsh and the birds. If that's what you like, then you will like this. I don't. The story is secondhand to all the descriptions of the girl driving her boat in the marsh. As others have said, it is a ridiculous story. If you want to believe that a six year old raises herself in the marsh, learns to read,  writes scholarly novels, stands trial for murder and then lives happily ever after, then this is for you; no one else.	15 people found this helpful
LNS2038	3.0 out of 5 stars	February 3, 2019	Hardcover	Lovely Descriptions of Nature but .  . . .	First, I notice a limited understanding of North Carolina geography..  There is no way someone living on the coast would go to Asheville for shopping.  That town is in the mountains.  There are much closer shopping destinations - e.g., Wilmington, Greenville, Raleigh, Durham, etc.Second, character development was weak. I cannot believe that none of the siblings would  be concerned about a very small child for that many years.  It's clear why they left but unimaginable that someone wouldn't have come back sooner.  And what about the town of Barkley Cove?  She may have been 'swamp trash' but she was white and that counted for something in those days.  'Saint' Tate was a puzzle, too.  As loving as he had been her whole life, why would he dump her when he went to Chapel Hill?!	14 people found this helpful
Denzil	1.0 out of 5 stars	August 19, 2019	Kindle Edition	A very poor book. I struggled to give it 1 star!	It’s a lesson I still haven’t. A book with Great Hype does not make a Great Book. Crawdads is the perfect example. 17,000+ reviews on Amazon.com. A rating of 4.8. It has to be an excellent book. Surely. No. This is a poor book, flimsily constructed with weak characters and an implausible plot.Although targeted at adults, it’s basically a Young Adult Coming-of-Age Romance with only three characters. Kya, a girl who at six years old is abandoned by her mother and then a few years later by her father too and therefore has to fend for herself in the swamps of North Carolina. Tate (perfect body, dark eyes, golden hair), is a young boy from the local town who falls in love with her and teaches her to read. And Chase (perfect body, dark eyes, but DARK hair), is a young boy from the local town who falls in love with her and whose body is later discovered at the bottom of a fire tower amid suspicious circumstances. So who killed Chase? In a book with only three characters, and one of them is dead, that doesn’t leave a lot of room for surprises.The book is also totally unbelievable. Tate teaches Kya English when she’s 14 years old. A few years later, Kya walks into the town library and asks for the Principles of Organic Chemistry by Geissman, Invertebrate Zoology of the Coastal Marsh by Jones, and Fundamentals of Ecology by Odum! She then writes – and has accepted for publication – a scientific paper! This is not only implausible but a huge insult to researchers who have had to study hard for years to achieve the same goal.Moreover, she lives by herself in the swamp but never gets ill, never suffers from malnutrition, her boat never breaks down. The dialogue is trite and simplistic. Finally, the minor characters are so weakly drawn as to be invisible. So we have cops who, surprise surprise, like eating donuts, and a cliché-spewing “wise” African-American woman.I could go on, but I’ve wasted enough time reading this thing. Thankfully I gave up after 51%.	11 people found this helpful
Ann Ali	4.0 out of 5 stars	January 8, 2019	Kindle Edition	Good marshlands drama	The sweeping feeling of life in the wetlands and the evocations of birds and seasonal rhythms transported me to another place entirely, which I loved. I enjoyed reading this story for its swamp life, for its easy, engaging storytelling style, and for its lead character Kya Clark, whose loneliness, frustrations, and deep love of nature I can relate to.  Kya’s emotional roller-coaster of life experiences swung me up, down and around with her, and I can easily imagine this story of courage and survival being made into a movie both lyrical and dramatic, with the atmospherics of fertile, beautiful, frightening life in the North Carolina wetlands reflecting varied themes of betrayal, loss, abandonment, female survival, poverty, love, the power of true friendships, and the need for meaning and connection in life.Having said all that, it's far from perfect. What others have written about the absurdity/shallowness of some plot elements is true....for instance, the story ignores any realistic insight on how a little girl survives by herself in a swamp, dealing with illness, hunting for food, etc... It is more of a woman's fairy-tale marsh romance-cum-mystery thriller.  I found the courtroom scenes especially contrived and melodramatic (in my mind as I read it, I kept thinking of the court scene in To Kill A Mockingbird for some reason). And heading to the end of the story, some elements I could predict. But what the hell, I still liked the tale for how it dealt with worthless men and for its touches of lyrical writing on the marshes (although if you've ever read the Dave Robicheaux crime thriller series by James Lee Burke, you'll quickly see that Burke's evocations of southern marsh landscapes, seasons and "zen" moments are richer, more nuanced and more emotionally moving -- but then, Burke is a much more experienced writer with many more books under his belt).	14 people found this helpful
Riverlizzie Reviews	4.0 out of 5 stars	October 22, 2018	Kindle Edition	Great nature detail, good story, ridiculous dialogue	The story of the wild child is not new, but it's done very well here with only a touch of implausibility. The murder mystery was very well done, and I loved that I was still undecided about the identity of the killer until the end.  Kya's comparison of the small-town prosecutor to the weaker marsh animals' antics to make themselves appear bigger, stronger, and more desirable was purely delicious. The marsh is the real star of this story, with plenty of beautiful, satisfying detail. The descriptions of Kya feeding the gulls made my heart ache with longing for that experience.Where the author fails pretty miserably is in trying to write dialogue in the vernacular. To do that well, a writer must pay close attention to consistency, which Ms. Owens does not. She has words and like sounds pronounced differently in the space of a single sentence, and more often than not, this reader was yanked right out of the story by the clumsy attempts at conveying an accent. Her rendering of the "colored" language was especially caricatured, to a painful degree. "Gwine"? Really?  It's a shame that the enjoyment of growing to love this wild, solitary woman was interrupted by something so easily avoided.	14 people found this helpful

The premise is preposterous; for example how does a 6-year old raise herself on "turnip greens" , etc, and grow to adulthood without ever getting sick, seeing a doctor or a dentist...by age 19 her teeth must gave been rotting out of her head!  Vitamin deficiency, lack of personal hygiene (no toilet or running water, soap, toothbrush...seriously?)  Feminine hygiene awareness/products?  There is no way any of this believable.  Actually insults the reader's intelligence and all sense of reason.	15 people found this helpful
Diana Elliott	1.0 out of 5 stars	April 10, 2019	Kindle Edition	Had potential, but failed	I enjoyed some of the book, but found it a too cliche and over done tragedy. Too hard to suspend belief about an abused and abandoned child growing up and becoming this avowed scholar from teaching herself.  Also inconceivable,  a child who never has dental care and no dental issues, never gets hurt or ill, and a shanty shack that never needs repair. The ending was underwhelming and disappointing.  The author, I guess in trying to do a twist to the ending, fails her character miserably and lets the audience down.  A mean southern cliche town without mercy, a good looking jerk, a thoughtful ‘good guy’ character-equals an old worn our plot. No idea how people thought this was so fantastic, low expectations I guess. It had potential, but failed.	13 people found this helpful

Susan Yates-Brown	2.0 out of 5 stars	February 13, 2019	Kindle Edition	Not My Favorite	This book has so many glowing reviews, I hate to be such a party pooper, but....I really didn’t like it. The feral child story arc didn’t seem to mesh with the teen/adult psyche of Kya. Her observations and philosophical conclusions were far too sophisticated for someone so culturally and socially deprived. I couldn’t summon up enough benefit of the doubt to invest in her ”survival” triumph.The romance aspect of the story felt YA to me with wooden dialogue and bodice ripper intensity and I felt like there may be other directions this character could have been led toward that were more creative and interesting than hooking her up with either a decent or devil boyfriend.I was also very disappointed by the mystery storyline that wound through the entire book like a tease, and then landed on its head in the end.I could list more issues that were bothersome to me, but I’d be entering spoiler territory and again, I know that many people have and will enjoy this book. Having spent the time to read it, I wish I felt the same way.	13 people found this helpful
Kindle Customer	3.0 out of 5 stars	November 29, 2018	Kindle Edition	Good story, simplistic character development	I loved this poignant story, and the author's eloquent and poetic writing enticed me to re-read many sentences several times just to savor the images they inspired. This would be a five-star read if the characters were more complex and less predictable. Also, the author's attempt to capture the North Carolinian dialect was inconsistent and awkward; and, finally, the ending felt rushed. Despite any perceived short comings, I still would recommend this as a book-club selection.	15 people found this helpful

Susan H.	4.0 out of 5 stars	October 28, 2018	Kindle Edition	 Beautifully written, but with some plausibility issues	I did love this book, the details in the descriptions made me feel like I was there. (Minor spoilers ahead) Now maybe it's because I work in the medical field, but I have a very hard time believing that a 7 year old with no money would be able to survive this type of environment with just a shack with no running water, no way to bathe, and lack of food. The author described plenty of beautiful things in these wetlands, but failed to mention the dangers. (Crocodiles, mosquitos, sink holes, hurricanes, etc.) At one point the author describes when her brother was hit in the face with a fire place poker (a gash that left a massive scar) and said her mother just sewed it up with her sewing needle. Without access to health care and antibiotics, that kid would have died from a massive infection! But plausibility issues aside it was still a great book with an interesting twist at the end!	13 people found this helpful

Thomas Moody	5.0 out of 5 stars	April 21, 2019	Hardcover	“Way out yonder, where the crawdads sing…”	Every so often a novel, written so profoundly and with such care and grace, will come along and capture you in an almost reverential way. Three recent works that have done this for me come quickly to mind; “Night” by Elie Wiesel, “The Prince of Tides” by Pat Conroy and perhaps my all-time favorite, “The Pacific” by Mark Helprin. All literary masterpieces and penned in their own unique vision of what literature should aspire to be, all three evoke in me a sense of import and sublimity not remotely approached in other works of this genre. And now we have first time novelist Delia Owens, who has also seemingly captured this essential essence of literary beauty with this superlative work “Where the Crawdads Sing.” Herein, she seductively integrates a myriad of topical issues into one cohesive narrative…1960’s southern class divisions, controversial social orders, Jim Crow racism and male violence against women. With these, then, Owens seamlessly weaves a dazzling drama portraying one young woman’s segregated life as she goes from young abandoned youth to beautiful and intelligent mid-twenties young woman. Not to be forgotten, she also spins a twisted and dramatic murder mystery, one that succinctly converges with our main protagonist’s life at the end.Catherine “Kya” Clark is the acknowledged “Swamp Girl,” abandoned by her mother at eight years old (due to untold beatings and abuse by Kya’s father) in 1952 and soon by her last remaining brother (all siblings have left for similar reasons) and her deadbeat father. Learning to survive on her own in the Outer Banks region of the North Carolina swamps, Kya becomes one with the swamp, spurning any real integration with local society, even fighting off attempts by truant officers to get her into school. As she grows older, and as she sees and ultimately meets a local boy Tate out on the intricate waterways, she learns that the yearnings she feels for him is the beginning of love. Tate, feeling the same, becomes her savior of sorts, teaching her to read and sharing her love of the wildlife area. Owens is magnificent here, touching the reader’s heart with Kya’s coming of age experiences while describing her and Tate’s budding relationship.Tate leaves, of course, going to college following high school, breaking Kya’s heart, before she ultimately becomes involved with local football hero Chase Andrews, one who appears at first to be somewhat honorable but maintains a suspicious side, nevertheless. And this is where the book’s plot explodes…Chase is exposed as the murder victim at the very beginning of the book and Kya’s relationship is, shall we say, considered very suspicious. Owens weaves an intricate plotline, taking the reader through a maze of twists and turns while never losing her literary touch.Without divulging much more, everything, of course, works out well for Kya. I would caution the reader, however, to pay careful attention right to the very end of this book…that is how well Owens has dispensed this mystery.A work that is so beautifully wrought and so profound that you’ll be thinking about it and contemplating its affect for days, “Where the Crawdads Sing” is an immensely powerful novel that will literally stop you with its literary appeal. From page one, the reader is taken in with Delia Owen’s grasp of the human condition and its assimilation with nature while touching your soul with a young woman’s coming of age, you’ll undoubtedly count this book, as I now have, as one of those almost “spiritual” works that has come your way.	10 people found this helpful
N. J. Williams	1.0 out of 5 stars	May 2, 2019	Kindle Edition	Had to force myself to finish this	...and only because it was a book club pick. Otherwise I would have given up by the end of ch. 3, when I'd pretty much sussed out the entire plot. The writing is overbearing & poorly edited, the plot turns predictable yet implausible, the characters lacking in complexity, the depiction of racial minorities stereotypical & offensive, the romanticization of rural poverty equally troubling. The only thing I liked was the descriptions of the marsh, which were often lovely & felt truly authentic. In the hands of a good screenwriter (please, not the author) & sensitive direction, I could see this being an okay movie. But cannot recommend the book. Honestly, its status on the bestseller list flummoxes me & makes me think less of Reese Witherspoon's Book Club, which is no doubt at least partly responsible for this mediocre book's outsize success. I'm an author too & am usually gentle with book reviews, but this one -- oh my goodness, just no.	10 people found this helpful
frizzylee	1.0 out of 5 stars	July 22, 2019	Kindle Edition	One of the most disappointing books that I have ever read!	I am truly amazed at the glowing reviews of this book. First, the positives. The writing was beautiful. The author did a wonderful job of scene description and character development (Jumpy and Mabel were my favorites). The author's knowledge of botany was evident and I liked how she compared life in nature to human attributes. BUT, unless you really want to read a coming of age murder mystery, do not read this book. As stated in other negative reviews, there was way too many things that were just not plausible. Really, I could rant on and on about a litany of things that were just ridiculous.  One of the most glaring ones was that this is a girl who was illiterate. She is taught the rudimentary skills of reading. But then she goes on to draw and write about flora and fauna. And, just like that, a publisher takes her information and publishes a book where she gets big royalties. Do you know how hard it is to get a book published- especially when the "author" is someone who is unknown and with no formal education?? That is just one small example of the flaws in this book. And, don't even get me started about the murder mystery part. So. please think twice before purchasing this book.	10 people found this helpful
galpalsal	3.0 out of 5 stars	January 31, 2019	Kindle Edition	Tried hard to suspend disbelief	I feel badly for not liking this book, as so many others loved it.  I tried to suspend disbelief (which I have done with other books), but could not.  It was just too unrealistic.  Too romance novel.  Why did the author keep talking about how beautiful she was?  Who cares?  It was totally beside the point and gave it that chick-lit feel.  Her survival skills were apparently magical.  Her boat never breaks.  Turning out as a famous illustrator was so cliche as to make me wince.  I needed more realism to like it	12 people found this helpful

D. S. Tharp	5.0 out of 5 stars	December 9, 2018	Kindle Edition	The Marsh Girl resonated with me.	After reading Cry of the Kalahari years ago, I was intrigued to find that Delia Owens had written a novel. As a boy raised by a single parent, growing up in the southeast in a time before cellphones and video games, I roamed the neighborhood and undeveloped woods around my house much like Kya. Exploring bird nests, catching snakes, and fishing in the creeks, I thrived in childhood because of these wonders. This book touched those places that kept me sane.Kya's story of being a part of her natural environment and Owens' description of the marsh transports the reader back to a simpler time before we forgot the small towns with people relying on each other for simple kindnesses. Her illustration of the line that separates “civilization “ from our beginnings as part of a natural order is poetic and important, especially in these days of destruction of our environment and mental anguish as a world that has become lost in greed and concrete.	10 people found this helpful

Steve Dossey	2.0 out of 5 stars	June 28, 2019	Kindle Edition	I don't understand the popularity of this book	I saw a woman on the plane reading this book and the title interested me. I read a blurb on it and decided to order a used copy. By the way the blurb was pure hype. This book must have connected with adolescent girls. There is a story there but the writing is amateurish, cloying, and juvenile. Maybe this book was intended for juveniles and if so I guess its popularity would make sense. Frankly I am surprised this book was even published. It was also touted for its "nature" writing but frankly there is nothing special there. I guess the lesson here is to stay away from best sellers since the last three I have read were pretty banal.	9 people found this helpful
Amazon Customer	1.0 out of 5 stars	August 13, 2019	Kindle Edition	Not Harper Lee by a long shot...	There's an article from 2010 in the New Yorker about Delia Owens and her then-husband Mark and their time in Africa. I didn't read that article until a few chapters into this book, when I went digging for background information on the author to see if I could quell the queasy feeling I got from her portrayal of black folks and race relations in North Carolina in the 1950s and 60s . I don't know what I was looking for, exactly, but "currently wanted for questioning in Zambia, fled the country after they opened a homicide investigation in which her husband and stepson are implicated" wasn't it. The anecdotes and background information in that article generally support my impression of the novel: the author's not necessarily a tiki-torch carrying white supremacist, but... well.Which is funny, because you can tell that she's really, really, really into To Kill a Mockingbird! The main character is Boo Radley, but prettier. There's an exchange of feathers and other treasures left in a tree (or rather, on a stump). There's a courtroom scenario involving an Atticus Finch stand-in. There's an underlying theme about the wrongs of discrimination. Against people who live in the marsh. Discrimination against people who live in the marsh is the subject of much moralizing; discrimination against black people (racial slurs, the occasional reference to segregated facilities) is just atmosphere. And you know, not every book has to be about everything, but if you're going to write a novel that takes place in the civil rights era, where black characters are your protagonist's main supporters, it might not be a bad idea to recognize that there are significantly worse forms of discrimination happening in your fictional world's setting than people viewing your main character with suspicion.And that's not even getting into the stilted dialogue, the screw-showing-I'm-just-gonna-tell-you storytelling, the bonkers character development, cringe-worthy love story, and the uneven plotting.I guess the nature writing was pretty, though, so... I guess that's a positive.	9 people found this helpful
aromanos	1.0 out of 5 stars	April 7, 2019	Kindle Edition	I’m in the minority but I hated it until 50% in!	We chose this book for our book club read, based on it having high reviews and being a top seller. This book could’ve been cut in half , in my opinion if the author would’ve left out all of the mind numbing details of the marsh and the birds and the wildlife. I literally kept skimming it and two of the women in my book club said they sped up the audible version just to get through it. It did pick up half way through when they go into the murder and trial. It’s also very unbelievable. A girl at a young age being abandoned in a Marsh never having any mayor issues or health concerns who grows up to be a scientist just isn’t believable. Also the names of the characters and the references of shopping in the nearby towns is not how it would’ve been in NC.  The names Tate and Chase should’ve been more like Willy and Joe, and the shopping area would’ve been Greenville or Raleigh. I wouldn’t recommend this book at all. I wasted a lot of my time on it.	10 people found this helpful
Ipaddlethesound	5.0 out of 5 stars	May 1, 2019	Kindle Edition	Beautifully written, absorbing story and wonderful characters	This story grabbed me from the first few pages, which is unusual because I usually have to stick to at least a few chapters before I get "into' a book.  The story of Kai is poignant and you feel her loss of family.  Such self reliance for a young child is amazing, but given her environment and previous lessons from her beloved brother, Jody - she succeeds in the marsh.  Her experiences in love, lost love and disappointment are heartfelt.  I kept routing for her in finding peace and love which kept me reading well into the early morning  hours.  The description of various plants, insects, birds and critters that live in the marsh were fascinating, especially their animal behaviors.  The author has vast experience in describing the scientific aspects of plant and animal life, but did so in an interesting and not boring manner.  I highly recommend this story - it is suspenseful, eye-opening, amusing and heartfelt.	9 people found this helpful

Elizabeth H. Cottrell	5.0 out of 5 stars	November 21, 2018	Kindle Edition	Beautiful, haunting, and lyrical...	This terrific book checked all the boxes of "favorite reads" for me: wonderful writing, vivid well-drawn characters, a fast-paced story, and the satisfaction seeing the protagonists experience love, hope, and redemption.Born in an isolated cabin in the coastal marshes of North Carolina near the town of Barkley Cove, Kya is dubbed by the locals as the "Marsh Girl." The author's lyrical and rich descriptions of the marsh are a writer's dream and carry the reader right into the story's world:"...slow-moving creeks wander, carrying the orb of the sun with them to the sea, and long-legged birds lift with unexpected grace—as though not built to fly—against the roar of a thousand snow geese."Six-year-old Kya escapes into the natural world outside her cabin to get away from her father's abusive rages: PTSD fueled by alcohol. Her mother flees, seemingly abandoning Kaya and her four older siblings. One by one, the siblings leave too, and while Kya's father works hard to be a better father, his demons are too strong. Abandonment is a recurring theme in this book.The story alternates between the time of Kya's mother's departure in 1952 and the year 1969, when the body of Chase Andrews is discovered at the base of an old fire tower in the swamp near Barklay Cove. As the book progresses, the reader discovers how these two lives—Kya's and Chase's—instersect. When Kya is befriended and taught to read by Tate, she is able to combine her love of words with her meticulous study of swamp wildlife to become a true authority on the area's flora and fauna, albeit without formal education. She and Tate become fierce protectors of their beloved ecosystem and then become lovers...seemingly too different to stay together yet drawn inexorably by their shared passions and values.Besides the author's remarkable descriptive skill, she shows a depth of knowledge about the spectrum of human emotion in her characters' behavior and dialogue. It all rings true."But loneliness has a compass of its own...""Biology sees right and wrong as the same color in a different light."In expressing the impact of reading poetry for the first time, Kya says to Tate (in her swamp dialect) "I wadn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full"My own heart was full when I finished this book.	8 people found this helpful
Michelle	5.0 out of 5 stars	November 30, 2018	Hardcover	Such a wonderful book!	First I want to say it has been 24 hours since I finished this book and I miss reading it. I feel like I have now digested the story and can possibly put into words how it made me feel. Kya (aka Marsh Girl) has learned about life and coming of age in a little shack on the marsh. I admire her strength and her capability to make the most of really ugly situations. Her love of all things nature and her ability to learn by observation make her so intelligent and beautiful. I loved her relationship with Jumpin' and his wife Mabel. They had so much respect and love for one another it warmed my heart.Kya endures life changing, heart breaking situations that form her. I really felt sorry for her at times, but happy and excited for her too. This book has so many aspects, love, loss, friendship. There is a mystery wrapped up in this story that really had me guessing what happened. I couldn't predict any turn of the book and I definitely had a few surprises. I ended the book with tears in my eyes and a smile on my face. These are the kinds of books I love to read. Don't hesitate to pick up this book and read it, you won't be disappointed. It is among my favorites ever read!	8 people found this helpful

Ms Owens ability to define longing and loneliness makes me want to capture her words in heart murmurs. So crisp is her understanding of human need.

storydrum	4.0 out of 5 stars	December 14, 2018	Hardcover	Sad Tale, but Worth the Read	I bought this so that I could participate in my mother's book club when I visited her last week. It gave us more to talk about, and I was able to participate in the group discussion.  From the start, it grabs you. The author's beautiful descriptions of the marsh and its plants, birds and animals, is spectacular. The story is excellent, as well. From what I learned in the group, the author started with the ending and worked backwards, going back and forth from the "present" in 1970 to the past, going back to the early '50's.  It is a post-Depression story that we who didn't live in those times, don't hear. It is in part what happened to people who were displaced by the loss of income and home, those who had PTSD before it was a known syndrome in those who served in the military, and the separation of those who maintained their status vs those who didn't. Ostensibly it is the story of a child who learns to fend for herself, a murder, and the parts others played in the drama. But it is more. Leading into the ending, for me and for my mother, was a tad rough, but hearing others talk about it, it was not so for them.  Highly recommended, whether for a book club or just for an escape to another time.	8 people found this helpful
Poodytat	2.0 out of 5 stars	September 7, 2018	Kindle Edition	Could Have Been Better	This was a 2-1/2 star book for me.  The first part of the book, about Kya's life in the marsh, was very interesting.  The part relating to the trial was wooden --- something out of a bad tv legal show.  I expected more out of this book.  I think the author was very good at setting the scene, but she didn't know what to do with her characters.  As a result, the plot was predictable.

John G. Metzker	4.0 out of 5 stars	December 19, 2018	Kindle Edition	Setting was my favorite character	I was attracted to this book, because I was interested in knowing about the locale of the book, which was the unsettled North Carolina coast. I got my money's worth. The descriptions of the area habitat and wildlife were obviously made by someone who had spent much time there, and expressed it well, in great detail.In my (admittedly male) view the story line was a slightly unlikely, gushing romance geared to the dreamy, female reader. (Sorry)From the first third of the book, there was no doubt how the story would end: girl meets boy. Girl loses boy. Girl gets boy. However, there was some interesting plot detail involved in the ending, too. It was well done.But having said all that, I confess that I did look forward to reading on toward the end. It is a job well done, and I would read another book by this author.	7 people found this helpful
PJL	3.0 out of 5 stars	January 29, 2019	Kindle Edition	Disappointing	While the author clearly has a remarkable gift for weaving a tale describing the world of Mother Nature, in my opinion, that's where this novel's tale is limited.  When  it comes to developing the individual characters; and their relationships with other characters, this novel fails overall.  It's hard to believe that any of this story would live in reality.  Kya's relationships/interactions with all other characters was really hard to swallow.  Can't understand how this novel (like to many reviewed on Amazon's site) was so highly praised by so many.	8 people found this helpful
Jennifer R. Pournelle	3.0 out of 5 stars	May 10, 2019	Kindle Edition	Fictional Geography	The protagonist of this story is both likeable and admirable, but insufficiently so to earn this I'll-researched pastiche of more original and better-written girl-survives-the-classist-south novels. It's abundantly clear that the author is no low-country native: the dialect is forced and wrong: the characters are dropped in from some other, imaginary southern space: the geography is impossible. Even now, in the age of interstates, it is not possible or likely to make journies described as quick trips by bus  in less than half a day of high speed motoring. Nevertheless, those failures of Carolina nativity, so grating to the ears of actual residents, might well be overlooked by those spring break veterans with good intentions, and for them, the opening chapters are well worth the read. Our courageous and plucky gal is quite compelling. Less so is the plot forcing that juxtaposes her early abandonment with a decade-later police procedural. This too is forced: all that csi-evidence gathering and expert witness testifying is simply anachronistic. Fiber analysis was barely on the radar of major metropolitan areas in 1969: certainly, it was not being practiced by elected coroners (who were rarely, if ever, even qualified medical examiners) in remote, rural, Coastal east Carolina. But those raised on a steady diet of televised crime drama might hbe able to suspend disbelief there, as well. So,  with these trigger warnings, go ahead and pack this into your beach bag for a summer read. It has its moments, even if no actual crawdad ever sang in the production of this book.	5 people found this helpful

I found myself deeply lost in the storyline feeling like I was truly there.  As a mother my heart hurt for this abandoned young girl left in the marsh to survive on her own with no help from the towns people.  Being abandoned several times did not stop her from making something of herself.  This book is a little bit of everything, a love story, a murder, a mystery complete with twists and turns.  I am glad I bought this one and know that I will re-read it again someday.  Very well written for a 1st book by this author.  I highly recommend this book.	8 people found this helpful

This may sound harsh but there is much to love in the book--an interesting location and the beginnings of two worthy characters.  I found myself wishing that Delia Owens might have a second chance at the book.  I wish the oppressive third person narrative did not feel like a high school biology lesson at times...and, something tells me that she took bad advice to make a lovely poetic book marketable and consequently we lost Tate's character to a flimsy plot development and Kya's final courage to a trial that would never have taken place based on anything resembling evidence.

CaliDreaming	3.0 out of 5 stars	April 29, 2019	Hardcover	Starts strong but becomes increasingly superficial and unrealistic	The first third of this book was a gripping story of abandonment, loneliness and despair.  The prose was beautiful and the description of the marsh makes you appreciate it almost as much as the main character, Kya, does.  I was willing to suspend my disbelief at some of the unrealistic scenarios presented during this part of the book due to the strength of the author's description of Kya's desolate emotional world.  How does a six-year-old survive the harsh environment of the marsh on grits and mussels?  I reasoned that she could have picked up enough from her mother and Jody before they left.  Tate's fixation on Kya?  I suppose Tate's deep sense of loss after the death of his mother and sister could have created a strong sense of wanting to protect Kya.  And so on.But as the story went on, I became less and less willing to excuse the unrealistic plot lines as the story drifted less from a serious exploration of the effects of abandonment and loneliness to a sensational story that concentrated on very contrived plot twists.  For the first 100 pages or so, I had believed the book was a serious piece of fiction, but after I read more and more, it started to remind me of a Lifetime movie.  Lifetime movies are entertaining though, so I still read on with interest.It was about this time I realized how undeveloped the characters were.  The depictions of Jumpin' and Mabel in particular were bordering on stereotypical.  I kept reading and hoping there was some good reason for this mildly offensive characterization, but by the end, it is clear that these are throwaway black characters whose sole purpose is to make the white heroine look good.I give this book 3 stars based on the strength of the first 100 pages and its entertainment value.  However, if you're looking for something deeper and more meaningful, don't even bother.	5 people found this helpful
Narci J. Drossos	5.0 out of 5 stars	April 19, 2019	Hardcover	From start to finish, this novel is a delight for the senses and the soul.	I love reading about the SE coastal region, and Owens takes me there.  I never thought another writer would capture its authenticity like Conroy, but she does.  There are so many little moments in this book that ring true to growing up in the south.  It breaks your heart and refreshes your spirit at the same time.  AND, there are some hilarious bits too.  I kept forcing myself to put it down so I could try to make it last.  I don't think I'm going to loan this one to anybody. It's a keeper to reread.

Johanna	1.0 out of 5 stars	September 24, 2019	Kindle Edition	Ridiculous Fantasy	Where was the editor that let Delia Owens get away with the absurd errors of geography and ridiculous events of this book?  Other reviewers have remarked on the fact that characters are constantly running to Asheville to shop or conduct business, probably a 12 hour drive in those days, passing by Greenville, Goldsboro, Raleigh, Durham and other cities and towns to get there. We are to believe that Kya's entire family deserts her as a seven year old and she survives alone in the marsh for the next eleven years. Mother, father, older brothers and sisters, all, one by one, abandon her and no one ever goes back to look for her. One brother was supposed to be especially close. Her mother takes refuge with relatives who knew about her abandoned children. They are prosperous and capable of finding them, even if the mother is a wreck, why don't they? Authorities in the town know she is living alone in the swamp, yet no one does anything. Yet, somehow, she survives.  She makes a meager living selling mussels she gathers in her motor boat, which never breaks down or needs repairs. And how did the shack survive the hurricanes? She lives on grits without adequate nutrition or clothing, never sees a doctor or dentist, yet blossoms into a beauty who attracts not one, but two of the town's most desirable young men.  She had only one day of schooling and only minimal tutoring by a teen boy, but she attains a university-level knowledge of science and speaks with perfect grammar and diction. She becomes an (untutored) artist and (bad) poet, and has her books on the flora and fauna of the marshes published to great acclaim.  Then the book becomes a legal drama/murder mystery. I struggled through to the end, for my book club, but I then wanted to throw it against the wall. Too bad I read it on a kindle.P.S. Read the Slate and New Yorker articles on how Delia Owens got away as a likely accessory to a murder herself. Wonder if she used that in her book.	4 people found this helpful

Rebecca	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 21, 2018	Kindle Edition	Insightful and heartwarming	This book is difficult to coin as a mystery, a love story, a book of nature or of the human condition. It is all of those things and more. Set in the lowlands/marsh of South Carolina in a remote cabin and the surrounding marshland, it takes you there the instant you start reading it to tell the story of a young girl abandoned and alone for most of her life and her struggle to survive her harsh environment. She grows up one with nature, taking the time become an expert in the all things natural that surround her. Sea shells, marsh grasses, birds, mushrooms and insects that are thick in the area and well detailed in the book. Her shyness and seclusion making her refrain and even hide from the townspeople she learns to survive with help from only a couple of others who sought to help her when they could. Shunned by the townspeople who had little understanding of her or her ways and abandoned time and again by those who she let into her quiet and lonely existence.The words flow from this author to sing to every soul who takes the time to read them. It combines coming of age, love, murder, kindness and selfishness into a truly great story anyone and everyone can relate to. having to read through tears streaming from my eyes the last third of the book, the bittersweet ending was worth every tear I shed to get there.I can not express how expertly this book was written and how well the story was told. It was full of details that made a difference. You won't want to miss one word of this beautiful book.	7 people found this helpful
Charles K. Billings M.D.	5.0 out of 5 stars	December 11, 2018	Hardcover	The Best Novel I Have Ever Read	This is quite frankly, the best novelI have ever read. The protagonist is a fascinating, mysterious girl, Kya, who is abandoned by her family, to grow up alone in the coastal North Carolina marshes. Kya turns to her natural surroundings to eke out a living, yet develops a fascination with the birds, the moss-draped oaks, the fresh water lagoons and the nearby saltwater ocean, the seashells, the winds, the grasses and wildflowers. At no risk of hyperbole, the author paints word-pictures which are vivid and memorable.The author’s description of the mannerisms, speech, and dress of the small town and rural folk, black and white, poor and less poor, is so accurate and honest, it almost hurts. And I feel comfortable making such a comment since I am a product of a small, Southern town. In fact, the author Delia Owens and I grew up in the very same South Georgia hometown.The lyrical descriptions of Kya’s close relationship with her natural surroundings and her more distant, even tortured relationship with others, would be enough to recommend this book. But I was caught off-guard by the exciting, even heart-pounding murder mystery, that intrudes and pulls Kya into it. And then the jolting, surprise ending—masterful!I will read this book more than once.And that is a rare event in my life.I look forward to the movie. Just this week came the announcement that Reese Witherspoon has purchased the movie rights to Where the Crawdads Sing. Further testimony to the merits and impact of this incredible story and literary work of art.	6 people found this helpful
Tom Feller	3.0 out of 5 stars	March 20, 2019	Kindle Edition	Girl Raised Off the Grid is Accused of Murder	The main character in this first novel is Catharine “Kya” Clark, aka “The Marsh Girl”.  Born in 1946, but abandoned, one at a time, by both parents and her four siblings by the time she is fourteen, she grows up on the marshy coast of North Carolina and goes to school for one day.  (She is able to evade the truant officers, who eventually give up.)  Kya makes friends with local boy Tate Walker, a budding marine biologist who teaches her to read, “Jumpin” and Mabel, an African-American couple who help her in other ways, and is romanced by Chase Walker, star quarterback and the scion of the richest family in the nearby town.  There are two story lines:  the first follows her life from 1952 to 1969, and the second is a murder mystery set in 1969.  They merge toward the end, because Chase is the murder victim and Kya the prime suspect. The author has co-written three non-fiction books on African wildlife, and the sections of this novel dealing with the life forms in the swamp are excellent.  However, the romance and mystery sections are rather weak, which is typical of a first novel.  I also found Chase to be rather stereotypical, and there were errors in North Carolina geography that even someone like me, who has never lived there, could spot.	5 people found this helpful
Kaylan T.	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 5, 2019	Hardcover	An amazing story!  Beautifully written!	This is such a beautiful story of a young girl who is forced to rely only on herself to survive.  Of course, no one can endure this level of abandonment, isolation, and ridicule and come away unscathed.  Kya loves the Marsh and all of the living and non-living things within it.  It has been her home and her friend throughout the years.  And yet, there is something that Kya still longs for.  The desire for meaningful human contact is something we all experience, and Kya is no different. This is a story of resilience, survival, love, hate, and murder.  You will feel as though you are in the Marsh with Kya, seeing all the beauty of it through her eyes.  You will find yourself angry at the townspeople for their behavior, only to have your heart swell at the kindness shown by a few. Reading this book will definitely put some things in perspective, like the things that really matter in this life and how kindness and love is something we all need to thrive.	6 people found this helpful
Susan Spencer	3.0 out of 5 stars	December 10, 2018	Kindle Edition	Disliked the Ending	This book was different and I enjoyed reading it, except that the ending didn't fit with the rest of the book.  It's like the author had reached a publishing deadline and had to hurry up and get it done.  Not everyone in my book club agrees with me, so you'll have to see for yourself if you think the ending fits the personality and behavior style of the main character.  To me, it just didn't work.	8 people found this helpful

Erin	2.0 out of 5 stars	February 23, 2019	Kindle Edition	Don’t waste your time or money	Unfortunately, the 1-3 star reviews on this book are spot on. The only people I actually cared about were Tate, Jumpin’ and his wife. I couldn’t get over Kya’s continuous pity party and lack of trying to grow and let people in. She was just too negative for me. Also, two major things that seem utterly unbelievable: her being left alone for all those years and then the courtroom debacle (those courtroom scenes made me cringe because it sounded so fake).Overall, a boring book that only kept me reading because I paid for it and I wanted to know who committed the crime (I don’t want to reveal too much).	6 people found this helpful
edel comerford	1.0 out of 5 stars	July 2, 2019	Kindle Edition	Buy a Mills & Boon Instead!	Oh gosh! I never normally write reviews of books, it's just not my thing but in this case I feel I just have to say something. I hummed and hawed for quite a while before I bought this book - via kindle - I was interested because it had come up in my recommendations and I saw how well it seemed to have been received by most reviewers. The few bad reviews intrigued me as they were so polar opposite to the good ones...........Boy do I now know why! I hated this book. I found it ridiculously unbelievable, the storyline was so far removed from anything you could relate to it was laughable. The prose was so contrived and over the top....... I could go on and on but I won't. Suffice to say I would recommend you save your money and buy a cheap Mills & Boon ( are they even still sold?) that's the level I would put this book on. I only finished it out of sheer contrariness, just to say I did so I could write this. I didn't feel it fair to review without finishing but neither did I feel it fair not to review and warn you off.	6 people found this helpful
Cathryn Conroy	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 24, 2019	Kindle Edition	Ingenious! Incredible! A Must-Read Book That Will Grab Your Heart and Soul	Oh. My. Goodness. Yes, all the hype is true. This is an incredible book that broke my heart, made me laugh out loud, made me shake my head in wonder, made me cry real tears several times, and made me oh-so-sad when it ended. (Book hangover!)Ingeniously plotted, the story begins in 1952 when the lead character, Kya, is six years old. And while the story is told chronologically from the 1950s to the early 1970s, it bounces ahead in time to 1969-70 and then retreats to the 50s-60s until the two merge. While at its core, this is the story of Kya's lonely and alarming life in North Carolina's primitive and untamed coastal marshes (the '50s and '60s), it is also—around the edges—a murder mystery (1969-70).Kya, the youngest of five children, lives in a dilapidated swamp shack with her impoverished parents and siblings—until one by one, they leave. Shy and terrified, the abandoned Kya does what no child should have to do: survive on her own. This is the story of not only her survival, but also her triumphs and redemption. It is a story about prejudice, evil, abuse and hate, as well as a story of the transformative power of love.Bonus: This is also a love story to the coastal marshlands. The descriptions of the flora and fauna are so detailed and the imagery so vivid, that the reader can totally visualize the lush land and teeming waterways—if not actually feel the need to scratch at nonexistent mosquito bites! The book is filled with facts that are presented in such a fascinating and utterly interesting way, that I found myself wanting to know more about everything from female fireflies' bizarre and cruel mating habits to why seagulls have a bright red spot on their beaks and what creates the iridescence of a hummingbird's golden-red throat.This is a must-read book!	4 people found this helpful
Montana Mackay	3.0 out of 5 stars	April 12, 2019	Kindle Edition	Good but Not Fabulous	When I see the thousands of 5 star reviews, I wonder if I read the same book as everyone else.  I appreciate the freshness of Owen's writing, which had a lyricism that knitted the plot together nicely.  I'm a naturalist myself, so anyone who gets mesmerized by a feather or a wasp wing is an interesting person to me.  But the plot ... oops.  SPOILER:  I don't think it's too realistic for a victim of sexual assault to go after her attacker.  And what in the heck was up with the red hat?  Much ado about nothing.  I also found the courtroom ping-pong tiresome ... not a favorite device.  I understand that suspension of disbelief is important in reading and art, but there were so many suspensions required here.  Nice diversion but not fabulous fiction.	5 people found this helpful
honeychile	4.0 out of 5 stars	February 4, 2019	Kindle Edition	Compelling read!	My ladies' book club chose this book for the month.  I read  this page-turner in just a few sittings and enjoyed the description of the tidal marsh area almost as much as the characters and story.  I had to suspend disbelief quite a bit in the beginning as the thought of a six-year-old on her own was incredible to me, but the author worked hard at explaining how she got along, how she evaded attempts of truant officers, and how she ultimately made her own way in the world.  There were a couple of interesting plot twists that I saw coming, but enjoyed anyway.  And my desire to see the underdog defended and justice ultimately served was satisfied.  As a woman of faith, I would liked to have seen the Creator among the descriptions of such interesting creation, but that's just a personal yearning.  The book is well-written and a treat to read.	5 people found this helpful
Laverne H. Bardy, Author and Syndicated Columnist	2.0 out of 5 stars	June 3, 2019	Kindle Edition	Beautiful writing, but unrealistic storyline.	Delia Owens is a master with descriptive words. I learned more about swamps, marshes and insects than I ever thought possible; so much in fact, that I found myself skipping over pages in search of human descriptions and more interaction with humans. It was unrealistic to believe this child was abandoned repeatedly, and yet she survived all illnesses, lived in a shack that didn't deteriorate over the years, lived on grits and didn't develop rickets, or any childhood illnesses. Her rickety boat never wore down, and even though everyone knew she was living on her own, no one cared enough to do anything about it. In reality, the story was good, the writing was beautiful, but if a chunk of detailed marsh descriptions were omitted, the story could and should have ended sooner.	5 people found this helpful
Schuyler T  Wallace	4.0 out of 5 stars	February 3, 2019	Hardcover	A PLAINTIVE AND ENGROSSING STORY	WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING REVIEWDelia Owens has written an extraordinary story of nature, both human and feral, that explores the coming of age of a Southern wild child.  In “Where the Crawdads Sing,” she tells of an abandoned six-year old girl, Kya Clark, who uses her wiles and inventiveness to survive, as she grows up alone in the remote marshes of the North Carolina coast.  She is known as the “Marsh Girl” who hides in the backwaters with the creatures of the swamp, shunning interlopers and eking out an existence of hardship and hunger.  Her entire young life is a struggle, carefully delineated by an author who is sensitive to the emotions of her protagonist, the natural beauty of her surroundings, and the readers who travel with her through years of a lonely existence.Two boys interact with Kia.  One is sensitive to her solitary condition, teaches her to read, and kindles the first hints of love she will experience.  He suddenly disappears, along with her family members. turning her into a distrustful earth creature.  The other, the nearby swamp town’s charismatic idol, becomes her second lover, less caring about her personally, who drags the girl into the public eye as a suspect in his death.  He also breaks her heart before he is killed.  The story becomes more predictable at this point, and somewhat implausible, but a unique twist at the end saves the day.Owens, with a PhD in Animal Behavior, co-wrote three other books, about her experiences in Africa.  Crawdads is her first novel and, while occurring in a far different environment, it contains some amazing nature writing and descriptions of wildlife behavior.  Some have criticized her for leaning towards flowery writing about the natural world but I found it spellbinding.  I was less impressed with some other sections that tended to drag but, overall, it was a great reading experience.“Where the Crawdads Sing” is a beautiful and wistful title, bringing to mind the plaintive song “Somewhere Out There,” a tearjerker for sure.  Although this story did not wrench tears from me as a reader, I could never erase the image of longing and anticipation found in that song.  Kia’s mindset paralleled those emotions.  My appreciation for this book was certainly enhanced by having that concept in my mind.  It was an earworm that stayed with me throughout the book.  Marshy land, the swamp, green water, mysterious creatures, and black shadows are brought alive by Owens’s writing.  It’s an enjoyable read.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES	4 people found this helpful
Robin Landry	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 2, 2019	Kindle Edition	A perfect blend of wonderful writing and great suspense.	The kind of book you recommend to friends because you know they won't be disappointed. The setting--North Carolina marsh lands--are as much of a character is this book, as any of the humans. Told in vivid detail, this novel makes you feel like you're walking with Kya through the white sands, or following along deer trails under giant oaks, or sitting beside her in her small boat trying not to get lost.This is the story of how a young girl survives her abusive father, and a mother who deserts the family to save herself. Eventually everyone leaves Kya and from a young age, she learns to fend for herself--and Nature, who provides her with food, shelter and a family of birds, and animals. Kya grows up wild, and lonely, afraid to expose herself to the townspeople who have only looked down on her. She finds a few friends, Jumpin' a black man who runs the gas dock, and his wife Mabel who are the only ones who give her help when Kya's father finally disappears for good.What I found most interesting about this novel was how Kya learned about Nature at a PHD level, where if she'd had a normal upbringing--along with a public school education, she might have had an ordinary life. Because of her isolation, she learned to observe her world, and had the time--with no distractions--to record it. She became an authority on the Marsh she lived in, publishing books about her world.The author gracefully leads the reader to the answer as to who kills Chase--something we learn in the beginning of the novel--if the reader is paying attention. As I look back over the novel in my mind, I could see how it was the perfect ending.This is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read--and it's a great 'who done it' novel at the same time.	4 people found this helpful

LPW Stoddard	1.0 out of 5 stars	June 10, 2019	Hardcover	Trite, overrated, annoyingly earnest.	What do people see in this book? It was selected by my book group and, unlike Reese W, I couldn’t wait for this slow, amateurish story to end. The author lost me in the early pages, when she described her main character as a “tiny speck of a girl,” a hack phrase readers have seen a thousand times before. (And why not flagged by the author’s editor, I wonder? Along with the painfully bad coastal NC dialect?) I hoped the book might get better at some point, but it didn’t. Right up until the predictable, pedestrian ending, it was a bland mish mash of lumpy tasteless grits. Remember the English Patient episode on “Seinfeld”?  My feelings about this novel are like Elaine’s about that movie. “I HATE IT.” If possible, it would be NO STARS for you!	6 people found this helpful

Paul R. Jones Jr.	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 2, 2019	Kindle Edition	Best Book I May Have Ever Read!	I will be honest, I do not read much.  I read maybe a book every 6 months.  I was searching for a good book to read because it's winter and I get tired of todays TV.  I looked on Amazon and looked at the bestsellers list.  "Where the Crawdads Sing" caught my eye because it had an average rating of 5 stars, so I decided to read the synopsis.  A murder mystery that averages 5 stars...sounds good.  I purchased and began reading, and I was instantly interested.  The description of nature; the wildlife, the marsh, ocean...it was all captivating.  The characters were well developed, especially Kya, who I feel like I know personally.I have never read a book that grabbed me emotionally, and this one did.  I read the 2nd half in one night because I cared.  I cared what was going to happen.  I cared about the characters and I cared about the wildlife.  I genuinely cared about these people and the story that was being laid out in front of me.  I had to finish the book after a certain point because I knew I would be useless until I knew the fate of the characters I had grown to care about.I hear this may be a movie.  I think this would be hard to duplicate on film.  A great book rarely transfers to celluloid with the same impact.This story deserves a 5 star rating.  After reading this, tell me you won't want to go to North Carolina and try to find this setting.	4 people found this helpful

J. A Bowen	3.0 out of 5 stars	May 21, 2019	Kindle Edition	Good for a first novel, not up to the hype	I really, really wanted to love this book.  I'm a big fan of Southern women writers, Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers being among my favorites.  At first I was pretty mesmerized, I must admit.  The plight of poor Kya and her family reminded me of the horrors of other, non-fiction books that have been recounted so brilliantly, like "The Glass Castle" and "Educated."  But as I read on, I found much of it to be unbelievable as well.  We are to believe that a six-year-old girl could survive on her own in the marsh without so much as a day's sickness, without medical or dental care, without being taken advantage of by drifters (the whole town knew about the "marsh girl" but no one came by to see her or, more likely, try to harm her?).  She is supernatural in her ability to subsist on grits and greens, and whatever she can get from her father's ramshackle boat.  The kindly African-American and his wife, who own a gas station/shack-store of sorts, are Kya's mainstay against the authorities, starvation, and almost everything else.  She lives illiterate and wild until a boy from the town, Tate, takes an interest in her and educates her.  Naturally, since she has a "wild beauty" (we never find out how Kya bathes or brushes her teeth or any of those other mundane details), he falls in love with her.  Of course she is gifted and highly intelligent, otherwise why would the book be worth reading?  I found the character development to be lacking as well.  The dialogue of Tate and Chase were so similar I had to keep checking to be sure which scene I was reading, and I didn't understand the use of the dialect.  "Ya" - is this particular to coastland North Carolina?  As for the murder/mystery part, that was so predictable I guessed it before it really started.  I sound harsh.  I do think for a first novel it is pretty good, but my favorite Southern writers have not been displaced in the annals of great fiction writers.  I made myself finish it because I had invested so much time in it.  There are also over-long parts about the marsh and marsh life that should have been edited.  I respect the author's knowledge but these sections were boring to all but a select few.	3 people found this helpful
ScrappyMags	3.0 out of 5 stars	June 24, 2019	Kindle Edition	Good but not living up to the hype	Scrappymags 5 word review: Enjoyable little tale but overhypedGenre: chic litShortest summary ever: The “Marsh Girl” Kya has never lived a normal life, and that’s an understatement. Abandoned and left to raise herself, she doesn’t trust many people until Tate who teaches her to read. But just when love blooms, he leaves... and Kya is once again alone. Flash forward and the body of popular Chase is found and the marsh girl is thrust square in the middle of it all. The story flashes back and forth as we get to know what it’s like to be truly out of the norm.What’s good under the hood: it’s a sweet Nicholas-Sparks-like if that’s your thang! I wasn’t expecting that from the hype and description so it was a bit of a let down in the mystery arena but it’ll make a great movie I’m sure.What’s bad or made me mad: I wasn’t expecting chic lit and I wanted a stronger mystery/court experience. A child growing up without socializing would likely have severe mental impairments and need services, so that part rang fake as well as the fact that no one came for her. Also the mystery wasn’t even a mystery, truly. Eh.It also paints the justice system in NC as a bunch of backward hicks. The prosecution’s case is basically laughable. No DA would ever take the case to court.Recommend to: Romance fans, chic lit loversNot recommended to: those expecting a mystery-type novel	3 people found this helpful
S. Corbett	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 19, 2019	Hardcover	Beautiful, memorable book, an intelligent work of fiction	This book goes on my favorites list. Unusual setting, characters, and situations. The youngest child in a larger family is ultimately left to fend for herself in a shack in a marsh area in North Carolina. Her abusive and alcoholic father drives her mother away, suffering a nervous breakdown. The older children leave as soon as they can to escape the father's rages. Kya is left alone after some brief good times with her father teaching her to fish, at age 10.This beautiful story is about Kya growing up mostly alone, learning on her own and using the things she has learned from her family, such as how to operate the old boat. Living things have a strong survival instinct and Kya manages on a very limited diet for many years.The author is a wildlife scientist who has written nature books, and the passages about wildlife are lovely and intelligent. A couple of young men come into Kya's life when she's older.There are volumes of reviews online for this book, a few of which I read after I finished it. The critics seem to believe that factual geography doesn't mesh with the story. This is fiction, so I didn't worry about that. Readers who are extremely critical and think fiction must be correct in their world probably shouldn't read this book. Everyone else will likely enjoy it as much as I did. It's a memorable story and is one of those books that reminds us why we read.My grandparents lived in a tiny town south of Columbia, NC when I was growing up. Marsh land according to the map. That's a long ways from Greenville, NC but it's possible to get there in less than 2 hours. There is much marsh land nearer to that city and Pamlico Bay goes inland towards it, so for those critical of exact locations, even though this is a work of fiction, perhaps they don't have a clear idea of where this possibly fictional place might be located. The internet doesn't yield a Barkley Cove in North Carolina, of that spelling. And those marsh areas do have non-salt water in some places. Springs, rivers, streams, etc. that flow toward the sea, not the other way. Marsh land abounds in the coastal areas of this state, with barrier islands and peninsulas to the open sea.Readers, I wouldn't get caught up in what the critics say. Judge for yourself and enjoy this special book.	3 people found this helpful
GinnyinGeorgia	2.0 out of 5 stars	May 15, 2019	Hardcover	Wholly unrealistic!!!	The story grabbed me right away but the tale became so far-fetched that I soon lost interest.  It went from the ridiculous to the absurd so quickly that I could barely finish the book but pressed on in order to find out if the predictable ending was as suspected.  I give the author credit for her ability to write a book that found its way to the best seller list.I must thank the Amazon seller for providing the book at a decent price which enabled me to recoup most of my money on Ebay.  This helped me from feeling completely duped!	5 people found this helpful

Richard J. Epler	5.0 out of 5 stars	December 31, 2018	Hardcover	Where the Crawdad’s Sing – a Truly Powerful Novel	This is a powerful novel that will appeal, perhaps surprisingly, to a wide spectrum of readers. It doesn’t escape me that to many in the intelligentsia it’s viewed mostly about the empowerment of women, which presumably is the correct marketing ploy for those that still read books (mostly women).But not to me. As an 85 yo male with a lifetime of experiences that can identify precisely with those of Kya. For me, her desire to depend on herself, and only herself, to solve the problems life has thrown at her ... to thereby find opportunities to discover the most inner depths of her soul ... especially in love and in her relationships ... is truly a beautiful thing to experience.Sex ... yes, but sex with need, feeling, and understanding ... in that order. In the end, all that matters is the understanding. Still those who love deeply are ever susceptible ... but we don’t really know in this novel.So rare is the power of this novel that It’ll be some time before I can read another novel ... or even watch a somewhat meaningful movie. I need to read it again ... with the understanding that I’ll no doubt find more insights into soul of the protagonist ... and maybe that of the author.The author lives in Northern Idaho ... I live in the high desert of eastern Oregon (4500’) ... with less that 2 people per square mile for the whole County. Yes ... I identify with the author of this grand book ... I suspect we may be kindred spirits. I look forward to her next novel ... maybe a sequel ... maybe not.	4 people found this helpful

Patricia McLaughlin	3.0 out of 5 stars	April 24, 2019	Kindle Edition	Bayou Myth	I understand many people flocked to the book and rated it highly. Mid-way, I felt this was a Bayou Myth: heroine overcoming all odds, improbable survival and lucky friends, unfairly accused of a crime, and resolution. My teacher grade is C+.By the time  of the trial, like that cagey ole Sheriff, I figured out what happened. However, along the line of the defense counsel, how could the crime have been committed and the poor heroine...one who has such little knowledge of city things, accomplish the crime and be ready for a special interview. Click, click, click.Yes, it was a fast read, and yes the heroine accomplished the heroic. I completed the book and felt mildly hollow. I didn't have burning questions or concerns to ponder as I have enjoyed with other books. That hollowness bothered me. I  could have predicted that, too.	4 people found this helpful
Jennifer	2.0 out of 5 stars	January 28, 2019	Hardcover	Spoiled By Clumsy Dialect!	The immense and intricately layered beauty of the marshlands is lushly described in this novel. Kya, the main character, demonstrates strength, courage, and resilience that awe the reader. The forward motion of the action keeps readers fully engaged. However, and this is a huge “however,” the author’s use of dialect is a woeful distraction. I am a lifelong Southerner, and I am intimately familiar with the varied accents heard on North Carolina’s Outer Banks. The author’s attempts to capture them in print are embarrassingly clumsy, at best, and seem downright condescending, at worst, which is a shame in a book so full of promise.	6 people found this helpful
JMB	5.0 out of 5 stars	April 28, 2019	Kindle Edition	Unexpected ending	This book was selected for a local book club. The Marsh Girl was a very young child when her family one by one all left her. Her drunken father stayed around for another year or 2, but left her too. She existed by digging for mussels as a little girl. After being harassed by the other children at school, she left after the first day there. She learned how to get to different parts of the marsh by taking he father’s boat & asking for help to get home. Everyone left her & she yearned to be loved & didn’t understand why everyone made fun of her, but she hung in & with help from another young person, learned the basics of reading & writing. From there she went on to writing books about the various flora & fauna of the marsh.I usually don’t like to read a book that bounces back & forth between different years. After a few bounces, I sort of got into the rhythm of the book. I thought I knew who the killer was, but was surprised at the end.Read this book of survival amidst  all sorts of insurmountable odds.	3 people found this helpful
Southwest Woman	1.0 out of 5 stars	March 27, 2019	Kindle Edition	Made me feel isolated and abandoned	If a writer can get you to feel what their main character feels they are considered successful. I read into this book and the bleak story made me suffer. I felt abandoned, alone and really terrible. I felt this character's surrounding family should have taken advantage of the march in which they lived. THe place was literally crawling with nuggets of protein in the crawdads. And the main character goes hungry. I really disliked this book and returned it.	5 people found this helpful
bethcross	4.0 out of 5 stars	September 19, 2019	Kindle Edition	My Theory on Bestsellers	A word about bestsellers: I hate them. I do not actively seek them out as reading material. This one has been at the top of the charts for SO long now, and the package IS pretty. My curiosity finally caused me to cave, and it was, pretty much as I anticipated, a 3-star read. Bestsellers usually are, for me. They're not terrible but they're designed to appeal to an average reader or to engage the predominantly non-reading public.This wants to lie in literary fiction on the scale between Uncle Tom's Cabin and To Kill a Mockingbird. I hated the first and can't remember if I ever finished the second. There, that's one of my ugly truths. Sorry.So how then, did it achieve 4 stars? The characters are type-cast, wonderful or mean. The writing is at times over-blown and caused severe eye-rolling due to syrupy sentimentality. The life-lesson wisdom is heavy-handed and the inclusion of poetry is just awful.I know, you hate me now. It's okay.But I've ripped the Band-Aid of my ugly feelings off so I could show you how this book worked for me in the end:1. The nature writing and descriptions of Kya's illustrations are beautiful.2. I genuinely do believe most people are inherently good, or at least, struggle to be, so the secondary characters do ring realistically on the spectrum.3. The ending. Just keep rolling your eyes till the ending and it will weirdly fall into place WHY this has been a bestseller for over a year. I think the author is blatantly manipulative as most of us are, capable of strong research and genuinely a really nice person.While I will continue to avoid Oprah and Reese Book Club recommendations like the plague and largely ignore bestseller charts, I'm glad I finally solved the mystery of this one. It can go away and leave me alone now.By the way, I never expect to be popular.Actual Rating: 3.75 starsFormat: KindleSource: AmazonCurrent ebook price: $14.99Opinion of Price: In another year or two, this will be in used bookstores everywhere.

Neutrino999	3.0 out of 5 stars	May 5, 2019	Kindle Edition	Du Maurier's genius, stolen!	I loved the book. In fact, it may be the only book I have ever read in a single sitting. But I realized after I read it that the plot was basically stolen from the book I coincidentally read just prior to this one. The main character is alone and isolated.  A possible murder has occurred. The reader is lead to like and sympathise with the character who turns out to be the murderer. There is an investigation and the murderer is acquitted/gets away with it. The setting and the characters are different, but the most stunning parts of the plot are a ripoff from Rebecca by Du Maurier.  I initially thought Owens mentioned "Rebecca" in "Crawdads" because the main point of the book was a built on similar themes, but Owens never mentions this in interviews.  She just talks about isolation and how she percieves that it affects people, and in interviews, she presents herself as a kind of authority on the subject based on her experience observing animals in Africa. What about the genius plot and themes stolen from Du Maurier? Du Maurier nailed isolation and feeling like an outsider as well.  I liked Owens' book more than Du Maurier's (which was great).  It is goog, and she is talented. If Owens was presenting her work as a re-work of all the important elements of Du Maurier's Rebecca (which it absolutely is), I would applaud this, but I'm annoyed. Du Maurier was the genius behind this, but she never got anywhere near the credit, because she was a woman writer in 1938!	2 people found this helpful
Kenneth C. Mahieu	5.0 out of 5 stars	April 23, 2019	Kindle Edition	5 star but I'll get picky, picky, picky anyway	What can anyone add to reader reviews of a book that has an incredible average rating of 4.8 from almost 10,000 readers?  Not much I’m guessing, unless you want to get picky about a couple of things.  So that’s what I’ll do.  “Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens is a very nice story that really doesn’t need its flashback structure.  I thought that added nothing and often was a bit of a distraction, and unnecessarily confusing.  The story is about Kya, a seven year old girl, who is abandoned by her mother as a consequence of the Pa’s drunken beatings.  Really? – Mom abandons girl to Pa who has already hit the kid? Yet Kya is left with Pa and an older brother (older siblings had drifted off years earlier).  But a couple of years later the remaining family has disappeared and Kya is left with no money, no education, no friends, no nothin’.  And somehow survives out of sheer grit and reading lessons from an older boy who lives in town.Kya loves the marsh, and is known to the locals as The Marsh Girl.  She loves the critters, particularly the birds that cluster all about her when she tosses them crumbs at water’s edge.  But it’s not just the animals; she loves the insects especially the sexy fireflies, the grasses, the trees (great hiding places) and all the colors – interestingly no snakes(?).  She borrows books from her friend Tate, and even the University library.  She draws, paints and makes notes of what she sees.  And then writes a book, then another, then….Really(?)  And she has become a young woman, who speaks better than most college grads.  Really(?)Ok, I am getting a bit picky here.  After all, this is a story, a grand story and some things are real stretches, and I haven’t even gotten into the characters yet, some of whom are a bit too.  As in “too good”, “too mean”.  In some ways, this book reminded me a bit of “Gone With The Wind” – another great story, with some flaws, but a great story nevertheless.There is a very long, very tense well-done section toward the end of the book.  An excellent court room drama that spans about two months.  My only criticism of those chapters is that a central character seems to disappear unaccountably for most of the period.  Post climax, there is a quick summary of the next 30 years or so that I thought was unnecessary and a bit overdone (hankie material).  But that was the author’s choice and I can live with it.This is a debut novel.  I enjoyed the story very much and find Delia Owen’s background very interesting – a great fit for this story.  I am hopeful of more from Ms Owen.  Given the success  of “Where the Crawdads Sing” I think it will be a great challenge for her to write  something that will meet reader’s expectations.	2 people found this helpful
Kindle Customer	4.0 out of 5 stars	May 29, 2019	Kindle Edition	Kya of the Marsh, like Julie of the wolves	Kya is a child who is abandoned to the marsh and learns to rely on the land around her as the only constant in her life for twenty years. Her mother leaves in order to flee an abusive relationship, her siblings leave, her alcoholic father vanishes, and the people of the town reject her as “marsh Trash” leaving her hungry and alone as a young child. In a way, it reminded me of books like Island of the Blue Dolphins or Julie of the Wolves in the way that she becomes so attuned to the climate and creatures around her. It’s very sad in a way, because as the reader you ask how much better her life could have been if the people around her had taken her in rather than shun her as undesirable.Despite the odds, she builds a life for herself and turns her love of the natural world into a career. She finds love and people she can rely on. The ending is much better than the beginning. I was happy to know that she overcame the darkness in her life and was able to create beauty.Oh, and there’s a murder mystery, but that mostly serves to expose the town’s overwhelming prejudice against her.I had to stop and then restart this book. The beginning third dragged out and at the time it was too depressing for me to read about an abandoned child. I restarted it a few months later and finally finished. There is a lot of really beautiful descriptions of natural places. I recommend the audiobook also because the reader is fantastic and reads in all the different regional dialects / accents.	2 people found this helpful
D.M. Turner	4.0 out of 5 stars	November 17, 2018	Kindle Edition	A story of resiliency and survival...	The beauty of this book was in the descriptions of the marsh and the depth of loneliness that protagonist Kya experienced at the hands of everyone in her life. Years ago I read a non-fiction book by the author, so while I didn't love this book as much as I expected to based on that previous read, I found many things about it to enjoy. The image of Kya's mother walking away stayed with Kya (and with me) for the rest of the book and epitomized abandonment and loneliness. I love books that trigger an emotional response, which this one did in several scenes. Owens' use of words was particularly riveting. Near the end, she writes: She closed her eyes at such easy acceptance. A deep pause in a lifetime of longing.What I liked less is you must suspend disbelief to continue reading. I found the story implausible. That a 6-year old girl could survive and thrive without help in the marshlands or in the later trial sequences the prosecution's case was so riddled with holes that the reasonable doubt issue screamed for recognition. Then, by process of character elimination , I figured out who had killed Chase - three-quarters into the story!Despite these issues, I was engaged throughout and enjoyed the story. It could have been a great book, as the author is highly skilled. Her knowledge of marshlands and her ability to share it with a reader is nonpareil.Kya made the statement: Our fears are more universal than we think. I'll go with that. Most of us think our fears are unique.	3 people found this helpful
Kindle Customer	4.0 out of 5 stars	March 10, 2019	Kindle Edition	4 Stars	This lovely little family drama / contemporary fiction is definitely worth reading.<b>SUMMARY</b>The story opens with the discovery of the body of a very well known, beloved man. At first glance it appears as though former high school football star, Chase Andrews fell from the top of the fire tower deep in the forested marsh. Upon further inspection, his death begins to look more and more like murder than an accident.Kya is the youngest of five kids in a family living in a shack on the North Carolina coastal marsh. Sadly, begins life with the cards already stacked against her; father is an abusive alcoholic and her family is extremely economically challenged. When it seems things are already about as bad as they could get, one day her mother walked down the driveway, out the gate and kept going. Kya was only six years old at the time.One by one, the rest of Kya's siblings left until it was just her and her father. With little to no parental help, love or guidance, Kya is left to maneuver the marsh and life in general alone. Kya spends a lot of time alone as she forges her way through life, trying to make sense of her world and to create a life for herself. Kya rarely goes into town, does not attend school, rarely wears shoes and becomes dubbed <i>Marsh Girl</i>, both a curiosity for the town and an outcast.Once a connection between Kya and Chase is established, who else besides town outcast, the <i>Marsh Girl</i>, would be the main suspect?<b>WHAT I LOVED</b>On the surface, <i>Where the Crawdads Sing</i> is a completely fascinating story of survival, which would be enough in itself, but it's so much more than that. Set mostly in the 1960's in a very small North Carolina town, this story, quietly has a lot to say about exclusion, discrimination and unfair assumptions based on preconceptions. It is about loneliness and the need for human interaction. In a large part, about forgiveness and love. All this without leaving the reader feeling like they have just been given a "life lesson" or being preached to.As an added bonus, the reader is treated to a glimpse into the wild life and ecological make up of an unblemished marsh.The final couple of revelations, in the very last chapters of the book were awesome. One of them made me like Kya much more.The most impressive aspect of this story is that this is author, Delia Owens, first novel.The cover is absolutely  beautiful! I feel like it captures the feel of the book perfectly.<b>WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE</b>This book was written in a style so lovely that it was almost poetic. The descriptions of the marsh, wild life, ocean and even the shells were vivid and beautiful. Most people would truly savour and <i>LOVE</i> those parts of this book. I know this says a lot about me, but I don't love it! I ended up skimming and skipping most of it. I kept wanting to get to the meat of the story.Partly due to the descriptions and partly due to the continued talk about Kya's loneliness, the first half of the book moves at a snails pace. That tends to drive me nuts. It felt like I spent the first 2/3 of the book waiting for the story to begin.Kya, the main character, seemed almost too good/ nice to be true. She should have been a little more three dimensional. Maybe part of that was the narrator's voice on the Audible version; she kind of made Kya sound breathless, bewildered and made of sugar. The majority of the book was sad and depressing. It started to weigh down on me after a while.<b>OVERALL</b>Although I didn't overwhelming love it like most readers, I cannot deny the fact that it's a unique and well told story. I am sure if will end up on many "top books of the year" lists.	2 people found this helpful

Tom McGee	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 31, 2019	Hardcover	One of the Most Intriguing, Touching and Enjoyable Murder Mystery's I've Ever Read! Buy it Now!	While Delia Owens has coauthored three international bestselling nonfiction books, “Where the Crawdads Sing” is her first novel. That is so hard for me to fathom!The storyline is so interesting and well-written, it is no wonder that it is a #1 New York Times Bestseller.The book tells the story of a little girl who grew up in the North Carolina Marshlands and was systematically abandoned by everyone she loved.  The first to go was her mother who could no longer take her drunken husband’s beatings.  Next, it was her sisters and later her brother and finally her father.Born in the isolated marsh in 1945, by her 10th birthday she was completely alone.  Remembering a few things her mother had taught, she survived off of grits and mussels her mother had taught her how to dig.  Before her father had left for good, while he was away she started his little boat and took is for a ride losing her way in the marshlands.  Luckily a nice young man, 4 years older than her, Tate, a fisherman’s son and friend of her brother, Jodie helped her find her way home.Although a truant officer talked her into going to a school where there were free nutritional lunches, she lasted one day after the kids made fun of her inability to read or write.  By the time she was 14 years old, she accepted Tate’s offer to teach her to read and write.  Once she caught on, it was not long until she was able to read and understand books far beyond her age level.Though she was 4 years younger than Tate, he was her first love and he had strong feelings for her too but was reluctant because of her age.  He began college and promised to come back on breaks, but failed to do so, breaking her heart when she felt abandoned by him too.Next, the athletic high school standout and ladies’ man, Chase Andrews made it his mission to try to be the first to ruin Kya’s virginity.  Unsuccessful, he changed tactics, took his time and finally succeed only to break her heart.When Chase Andrews was found dead, Kya quickly became a suspect and found herself in jail awaiting trial for murder with a death sentence hanging over her head if convicted by prejudice townsfolk on the jury.Folks, this 368-page novel is more than a great murder mystery. It is a nail biter that will keep you spellbound late into the night, feeling the pain, heartbreak, and suffering that this beautiful lady has to endure.Completely satisfying, the author has an addicting writing style and ability to tell a story that will keep you guessing through the very end while it pulls at your heartstrings and brings a tear to the eyes of even the toughest of men.Enjoy!	2 people found this helpful
Texasshopper	2.0 out of 5 stars	May 20, 2019	Hardcover	too depressing to keep going	Let me start by saying that I have been a voracious reader of fiction for over 50 years, --- I'll read just about anything, so it's hard to find a decent book I haven't read before. Was excited by the many great reviews.  BUT --- this book went on and on about this child's depressing life in the swamp until it was just too awful to keep going. Have no idea what happens after that (did she ever get out of the swamp, or grow up, or what?) so maybe it gets amazing later.  I had the sense this was the prologue to the child's later, adult story but if so it went on way too long.  I get it, okay?  She had a tough childhood.  If the child stays in the swamp for the whole book then I'm glad I quit when I did. Just felt the author was straining to make a  point that was already overburdened. It wasn't a story so much as a description of this child's awful circumstances. This made me not hopeful for the rest of the book so I quit.  A good example of how it can be done right is Angela's Ashes --- a great story about a really terrible childhood.  Depressing but a good read.  This one was just depressing.  Plus, felt this was not too realistic -- I live near swamps and a child running loose in one would die in about two minutes from water moccasins, alligators, quicksand, drowning, etc.  On the other hand, perhaps not a fair reveiw since I only read the first six chapters. When I opened chapter 7 and she was still in the swamp, I gave up.	3 people found this helpful
lazygirlreads	3.0 out of 5 stars	June 19, 2019	Kindle Edition	Meh.	<whispers> I didn’t really like Where the Crawdads Sing. <quickly hides>🦅Delia Owens clearly has a great knowledge and appreciation of nature and it shows through her writing. Her many descriptions of Kya’s world throughout the book are both lovely and lyrical but, for me, slowed the story down too much.🦅I really expected and wanted to like this book because so many people I respect LOVED it. The pace of the last third of it picked up quite a bit but there were things that weren’t for me. The point of view felt stilted and in several places the tense changes (outside of the MANY flashbacks and time changes) which pulled me right out of the story, so overall my read of this book felt stuttery.🦅I kept thinking - what is this author trying to get across?  The book felt like a family drama turned survival story turned ode to the natural sciences turned YA romance turned mystery/court procedural followed by a plot twist disguised as an epilogue.🦅There was definitely beauty in this book but overall, I just couldn’t fall into the story.🦅#bookreview #bookstagram #bookish #igreads #wherethecrawdadssing #bookquotes #lazygirlreads	2 people found this helpful
CrazyAboutBooks	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 12, 2019	Hardcover	A ten star plus book	I loved this extraordinary book. Ms. Owens draws pictures with words that rivals paintbrush on canvas. In fact, the book is one long canvas of beautifully written words, page after page. One can feel Kya's isolation and pain, smell the marsh grasses and palmettos all while sneaking peeks at Big Red. I grew up with the adage "different strokes for different folks" so not everyone will enjoy WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING. Unfortunately, it is a tragedy that reading the classics (in addition to more entertaining "beach reads") is no longer a requirement or is not as strong as it once was. Reading many voices and genres contributes to an appreciation that staring at text messages won't necessarily satisfy.To be clear this is fiction and fiction always, always requires some suspending of belief. In this book, there are no car chases or major escape scenes or near misses for the detective or blown up cars so if action-packed is what one enjoys, then this book doubtless would not suit those readers. On the other hand consider this small literary passage from WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING:  "She stared at dust motes, dancing silently in one direction as though following some dreamy leader. When they hit the shadows, they vanished. Without the sun they are nothing."I've seen dust motes many a time so I marvel that an author can give such personality to them! Of course, most of the beautiful words revolve around the marsh and its inhabitants, Kya, her family, her loneliness and her feelings and the townspeople not dust motes. However, that snippet is classic to how well written this book is all throughout. Of note Asheville is not as close to the coast as some other North Carolina cities but Asheville is surrounded by mountains, an attraction held out to Kya (a full day trip she is told), plus her paternal grandparents reportedly lived there (not a spoiler).The mystery is handled perfectly. But that mystery is only one element of the book. It is so much more than that. Kya is not the first young child (real or imagined) who had to (has to) survive against many odds: in Kya's instance, the erratic Monday money for food while still a child just to name one. Other discussion points such as whether or not it's fire flies or lightning bugs is so beside the point IMO since it depends on where one grew up. We called them lightning bugs but out of town relatives called them fire flies. They are the same insect and very entertaining to watch. Kya tells us much about these insects that I did not know and this information fit into the story. (BTW, there is a great show in the Smokies put on by lightning bugs (fire flies) during their mating season. People actually take chairs and go watch!)  Aside from quibbles about southernisms (LOL) some have, the book holds one's attention from beginning to end. The ending was perfect. It suited the book I believe. This book has earned its 5-star rating and I hope Ms. Owens writes another book soon.Finally, the descriptions of the marsh itself and its many inhabitants, including Kya, is worth the price of the book yet the reader gets all these bonuses: a mystery, human survival, human relations contrasted with extraordinary naturalist behavior and descriptions and an aching heart for all the Kya's of the world. Highly recommended for those who like a great story interwoven amongst beautiful, haunting words.

Kindle Customer	5.0 out of 5 stars	December 10, 2018	Kindle Edition	I'll  crow about this novel!	This novel is finely written, and brings us into the world of marsh flora, fauna, and feathers. Through the main character, Kya, we learn how solitude, healthy affection, and education can affect a human. And, to be fair, we must also look at the opposites: social status, especially entitlement,  lust, and ignorance. Kya is a product of a severely broken family with alcoholism and physical violence at its core. It does not surprise me that she finds more solace and peace in the marsh than at any other place. Kya's life is far from simple.As though her growth in this environment is not enough to keep a reader entertained, the novel includes a mystery: why is there no physical evidence around a body found in the marsh near the fire tower? The townspeople are shocked by the death of this young man, "football hero," and "all-around great athlete." Is his death an accident? Who would want him dead?  Ms Owens, herself a scientist, understandably imparts a vast amount of information about the marsh. (Personally, I liked that!) But this author also draws characters and plot well. Truly those three elements (setting; characterization, & plot) make for a number one, five star novel.I highly recommend this book.	2 people found this helpful
Chris o	2.0 out of 5 stars	July 7, 2019	Kindle Edition	Contrived and Annoying	Pretty disappointing...  Sure the descriptions of the marsh (and of food) were beautiful and I really enjoyed that... but the story of Kya wasn't great.  There was a lot of "telling" but not showing.  The writer "told" me what the character was feeling often, but I never felt any connection to the characters of their emotions.  As far as a story, it simply wasn't believable, and I enjoy fantasy and magical realism, but that's not what this book was.  Additionally, the love relationships never reached a maturity level that me, as an adult, could relate to.  They felt like relationships that a YA reader might relate to and enjoy.	3 people found this helpful
sanoe.net	4.0 out of 5 stars	October 13, 2018	Hardcover	A bit slow here and there but so atmospheric	"Where the Crawdads Sing" by Delia Owens is set in the mid-20th century. It is about a murder but also about a girl nicknamed Kya, also nicknamed the Marsh Girl.She comes by the Marsh Girl nickname due to the circumstances of her life in that she's lived outside of the town and in the marsh areas. Her father was drunk and all around terrible person. He drives off of everyone except for Kya who has nowhere else to go. She makes her life solitary life in the marsh but there are moments that begin to draw her out while her beauty draws a few notable people in. Including a handsome  young man who ends up dead and she ends up the main suspect.It can get a bit slow here and there, but overall, it is a book that draws you in and keeps you there until the last page is turned. It is very atmospheric and oddly nostalgic. At the same time, Kya and the people in her world seem familiar. I can see this story being made into a movie easily as it has a certain cinematic quality to it.	3 people found this helpful
Wendy	3.0 out of 5 stars	June 8, 2019	Kindle Edition	Marsh girl	The book was rather slow, mostly the first half.  Kya and family had to move out to North Carolina coast in the marsh.  Father not nice to the mother, who leaves, and so on of the kids by how the father treated them, leaving poor Kya with him, half the time he wasn’t there, and eventually he’s gone. everyone has left poor Kya, surviving on her own, making little bit of money for grits and gas. Makes friends with a boy who teaches her to read and write. She makes painting of the shells, birds in the marsh that helps her make money. She meets Chase, she likes him, they have a relationship, but he marries another. heart broken she trust no more. Then Chase is found dead, and she accused of killing him. She goes to trial.  This book was so good, with the descriptions, felt like I was there seeing it all, started a little slow, then it picks up and gets so good, sad how the towns people treated her, and no one tried to help her, but Jumpin and his wife! God bless them! I highly recommend this book, did she or didn’t she?  read to find out and see the places she sees!!	2 people found this helpful

This is the author's first novel? And her other books are nonfiction about Africa--not the North Carolina swamps? Astonishing. But as the story progressed it became increasingly far-fetched, and its heroine too pretty and perfect. It continued to entertain me and keep me guessing, but it was no longer a fully realistic world, and the "reveal" at the end was highly implausible if not impossible.	4 people found this helpful

Robert Clark	1.0 out of 5 stars	April 22, 2019	Kindle Edition	Cheesy Romance Novel False to Nature (humans, animals, landscape)	The author did great anti-poaching work in Africa and has a Ph.D. in field biology. Yet she knows that general readers love to see animal behavior as if it mirrors human behavior.  So she tossed what she really knows about animals out the window to write a book that would sell well, as did her non-fiction work.  The Romance Novel part of the book is by-the-numbers and preposterous.  The doggerel poetry must be skipped.  Entertaining book of no value.	4 people found this helpful
FCD117	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 5, 2019	Kindle Edition	Excellent, Compelling Writing, An Great Debut Novel	This is a really great debut novel by Delia Owens.  What I liked most about this fine novel is the writing style.  The author's style is picturesque and has a flow to it.  It is clearly written, but is not a light read.  It is the kind of book I needed to give my full attention.The story involves two separate time lines that slowly weave together.  The protagonist is a young lady who has a difficult childhood and who learns to cope with life on her own terms.As I stated above the writing is often exquisite.  Although very good, the story itself is not quite as good as the writing.  But the writing is so great that for the story to be as great as the writing would make this one of the greatest novels ever written.  I would not go that far.  But the book overall is excellent.As is often the case I listened to the audiobook while simultaneously reading the book on Kindle.  The narrator is Cassandra Campbell.  The audiobook is as excellent, and is worthy of the writing.  I have what I refer to as a "flawed inner narrator".  As such the audiobook was really worth the extra expense to me.****  Above, I have tried to avoid references to the story, one may wish to skip the below until after reading the book. ****If one has already decided to read the book, one may wish to skip this part.  I will try to remain vague.There were parts of this story the seemed unlikely to me.  When one parent departs and goes to her family, they seem to make no attempt to find her children.  As a grandfather, this is unthinkable to me.  Supposedly there were some threats.  That would mean nothing to me.There is also a violent felony mystery within the story.  As a retired detective, there were parts of that episode that I found completely outside my personal experience.  I am not saying the matter could not be resolved, but they did not even come close.  It is not that really amateur hour police work never occurs, it does.  But a case that weak does not go to trial, especially with the potential penalty involved.  It was more like a civil trial than a criminal trial.  I suppose those were the parts of the story that were most unrealistic to me and bothered me the most.It is the WRITING that I found most compelling.  And most of the story is really quite good.***** End of discussion of the story itself.  *****In summary, I felt this is a really great reading experience.  I am so glad that I had a chance to read this book.  I absolutely intend to read her next novel should there be one.  As I compose this review there is no second novel of which I am aware.  Should there be one, I will seek a copy immediately.  Thank You...	One person found this helpful
Patricia T.	2.0 out of 5 stars	May 18, 2019	Paperback	Slurpy	Language was good, however, getting closer to the end, I figured out the ending, all the loose ends wrapped up in a sickening slurpy way -- and in my opinion ruined the whole book. Just ridiculous story with yet another heroine who must have a very gamey smell and despite never actually bathing or having a female influence around, develops into yet another tall, thin, gorgeous voluptuous woman living in the wild with men lusting over her. Ridiculous. Also, could have used a better proof reader. How this book ever got on the NY Times Bestseller List is beyond me. I give it 3 out of 10 only due to the admittedly beautiful descriptions of scenery, smells, etc.	3 people found this helpful

I hate when pieces of tripe like this get undeserved  attention while many, better-written novels languish.

sarah Scott	1.0 out of 5 stars	June 30, 2019	Kindle Edition	Waste of time. What a letdown.	I was so excited to read thiis book as a friend who has previously suggested some great reads, strongly recommended it. The book is clearly a favourite of many other people too. Argh, I am so disappointed and irritated by it that I am going to give up on reading it. The story is ridiculous beyond belief and so full of twee stereotypes that I am becoming more annoyed with every page I read. I am astounded that it has so many positive reviews. I have just read the enthralling and beautifully written, Woman in Berlin. This book is is just tripe in comparison. Like a brightly coloured, horribly tasting dessert after a delicious and sumptuous main course.	3 people found this helpful
L. J. Roberts	4.0 out of 5 stars	September 4, 2019	Hardcover	It may not be the best book ever written,  but it will stay with one a long time.	First Sentence:  Marsh is not swamp.Kya Clark, aka Marsh Girl, virtually raised herself.  Her ability to watch and learn, and to depend on her North Carolina marsh allowed her to survive. When the handsome son of a prominent family is found dead, Kya is accused of his murder.  But was it an accident? Did she kill him?  Only with the help of others might Kya survive this, too.An author who paints pictures with words is one to be savored.  Owens does just that and does it beautifully.  There is a strong, lyrical quality to the writing—"Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother."The author does employ devices one may find annoying: multiple POVs and time fluctuations. Give it a chance, however. Before long, one may find oneself thoroughly captivated and willing to overlook those things.  Instead, one becomes immersed in a wonderful story filled with interesting characters, a setting which engages all the senses and emotions, and a desire for some real Southern cooking—"The aroma of sausage and biscuits, boiled turnip greens, and fried chicken thankfully overtook the high smell of fish barrels lining the dock. … Behind the counter, owner-cook Jim Bo Sweeny darted from flipping crab cakes on the griddle to stirring a pot of creamed corn on the burner to poking chicken thighs in the deep fryer…"Owens' descriptions are magnetic. She knows how to engage the reader—"There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot."  It is not all description.  The author creates interesting, strong secondary characters, including Jumpin', his wife Mabel, and particularly Tate—"His dad had told him many times that the definition of a real man is one who cries without shame, reads poetry with his heart, feels opera in his soul, and does what's necessary to defend a woman." One also learns the meaning of the title, and celebrate Kya's successes—"I wadn't aware that words could hold so much.  I didn't know a sentence could be so full."  Wouldn't one love to remember when one had made that discovery?Although there is a slight sense of fantasy about the plot, one can't help but be entranced by Kya's strength, courage, and perseverance—"I have to do life alone.  But I knew this."  But it's not all misty light.  Owen's takes us into Kya's feelings of being confined and through the trial, which was well done.The book isn't perfect.  The actions of one character don't always ring true and one may start to feel a bit manipulated. However, there is no question but that one's emotions become completely engaged to the point of possibly shedding tears at the finale; not a sad cry, but a lovely-ending cry."Where the Crawdads Sing" is a very good book.  It may not be the best book ever written or that one has ever read, but it is one of those rare books which will stay with one a long time. It will be interesting to see what Owen's writes next.WHERE THE CRAWDAD SINGS (Myst/Novel-Kya-North Carolina-Contemp) – VG Owens, Delia – 1st book G.P.

Quarterback's Mom	2.0 out of 5 stars	January 8, 2019	Kindle Edition	Needed a good editor	I think this author has a lot of gifts.  What bothers me - and it's far too often - is the distinct sense that publishers tell these authors that the novel has to be at least 350 pages or no one will take it seriously.  I felt that my time was highjacked.  I cared about the people, but the narrative went far, far afield.	5 people found this helpful
Anonymous	3.0 out of 5 stars	May 2, 2019	Kindle Edition	Won't be everyone's cup of tea	At times this book was poignant, at most others it felt unnecessarily verbose. This is a book with a LOT of descriptive language. It was about 150 pages longer than it needed to be, and I feel the longer the author stretched out the story, the weaker her message became. In the last chapters, she essentially negates the message she had seemed to be working towards for the majority of the book, leaving the reader to walk away wondering "well, what was her point after all?" Needless to say, my patience was paper thin by the book's conclusion.A lot of plot points/character types/themes in this book seemed too heavily borrowed from "To Kill a Mockingbird," and most unfortunately not executed anywhere nearly as well as the classic.That being said, I do know a lot of people who loved this book -- therefore I'd still encourage someone to read it if they were considering it -- whether or not you'll like this book probably depends on the style of writing you enjoy.	2 people found this helpful
Jayne P. Bowers	3.0 out of 5 stars	September 12, 2019	Kindle Edition	The Swamp Girl	There are many things I love about this novel, among them the beautiful descriptions of the marsh and its inhabitants, animal and human. In fact, I read the prologue three times before even beginning the book and returned to it a couple of times throughout. "Marsh is a space of light, where grass grows in water, and water flows into the sky." Yes!I could see Kya sleeping alone (no family or friends around) on her cot on the porch, hear her talking to the birds, feel her pain the one and only day she went to school, sense her hunger as she scarfed down Crisco and Saltines, and watch her take the boat out, but I could not wrap my mind around a child of six growing up alone in a shack of a home decade after decade. After her mother leaves, so do her siblings (all older than she), and her father. Her father returns for a season, and for a while it seems like things might work out, that he'll stay and take care of Kya. But no.Everyone deserts this small child, and yet somehow she survives, even thrives, alone in an isolated shack. I might have missed it, but I don't recall any mention of warm soapy water for showers or dishwashing, electricity for basic daily living, or loving guidance from family or friends. Her boyfriend teaches her to read, and coupled with her extensive knowledge of the marsh, she is able to publish successful, scholarly books.The writing is spectacular. There's a murder, too. But the story seems implausible.	One person found this helpful

Josh Rappaport	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 23, 2019	Kindle Edition	UNUSUALLY good book	Beautifully written, reading like prose poetry. Intriguing story with interesting plot, an exciting murder trial and plot twists that keep you guessing all the way to the very end. Strong development of the characters, depicted with depth and three-dimensional psychological realism. Also a wonderful description of this once-pristine marshland off the North Carolina coast, written by a renowned and award-winning nature writer. Makes me want to learn much more about this ecosystem. My only negative was that the main character's early-year survival, while incredibly page-turning, was perhaps just a bit hard to believe. Aside from that, I would say that this is one of the two best books I've read in the past 10 years. What an amazing debut novel. Bravo to Delia Owens!	2 people found this helpful
Jenuine Reflections	2.0 out of 5 stars	May 24, 2019	Hardcover	Taking an actor's advice on books = mistake (spoilers)	Reese Witherspoon recommends this. That should have been my red flag. Two stars because the nature descriptions are poetic and precise, but they go on and on. A little decorative prose lifts a story; when the plot is hung all over descriptions of every living thing plus everyone's lunch, I'm skimming, not reading. The plot could have been written by a 9th grader: the perfect girl, the perfect guy but, oh, he makes her wait, so she goes to...the villain.  The dad's a bad guy, but mom's forgiven because "reasons."  As for the murder, how is this suspenseful? The one person who could have "done it" is the one who did, but because proving beyond doubt is elusive, the murderer walks free. This novel uses comparisons with nature to justify crime.

anonymous	4.0 out of 5 stars	May 12, 2019	Hardcover	Incredibly...OK	I'm not completely sure what to say about this book that hasn't already been said, so I'll just say it's a compelling, creative story that's well-written for the first half, but not so well-written for the secold half.I really enjoy books set in the South, and this one had all the boxes checked -- Southern setting, good story, colorful characters. Unfortunately, it also got a little too hokey in the second half when the author stepped out of her area of expertise (nature writing) and into the unfamiliar territory of writing love scenes and courtroom scenes. The courtroom scenes are so implausible as to be laughable, and the romantic scenes unfortunately devolved the book into little more than a romance novel.It's books like these that really make me wonder what it might have been in the hands of a really good editor. I think better editorial advice would have made a book that was better researched for the courtroom scenes and also one that didn't rush to wrap things up at the end. The humanity of the characters seemed to be tossed out the window with "this happened, then this happened, then this happened -- The End" -quality writing. The whole thing seemed to wrap up in the last ten pages or so at a remarkable pace.I'm sure that finding the right way to end a book is one of the most difficult parts of writing one and sadly, this one dropped the ball. Still, I think it's a solid first effort from Delia Owens, and I would definitely read another one by her if it's forthcoming.	One person found this helpful
mac	5.0 out of 5 stars	November 13, 2018	Kindle Edition	Intreging chacter whose story line keeps shifting	First of all this is the best writer I have read in a very long time. Thoughts and events are communicated clearly and in each event the writer paints a clear picture in your head. I have not read any pure fiction for awhile, so I had to get rid of my prejudges about the somewhat overdrawn characters. But once I adjusted, I could appreciate a story with continuously shifting story lines, all held together by the central character. First I thought this was a book about a severely dysfunctional family, then add in an extremely accurate and poetic portrait about the ecology of the North Carolina coastal marsh (a reference to Aldo Leopold hooked me in), then we find out the main story line is a murder mystery. How can you beat a well written story, with depth in each story line, continuously shifting themes, and  finally an ending that is predictable but surprising never -the- less. And, I love the title.	2 people found this helpful
Linda L. Oliphant	5.0 out of 5 stars	October 28, 2019	Hardcover	The good, the bad, the ugly...and the beautiful.	I love the lush descriptions that flow much like the waters in and out of the marshlands.  Perhaps, it’s because I’ve been there...in those wetland waters of rivers and streams. There is a kind of silence heard. It resonates. It is both peaceful and a bit unsettling at the same time. It is its nature...I  can picture young Kya laying her hand “upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.”I read how Kya first learns to survive and then cope all alone. She soon realizes that she is “swamp trash”. Yes, there are questions raised by other reviewers but I chose to accept the book at face value; to just accept all the buts, the what ifs, and the skepticism of how she could live much less survive in the marshy back waters alone. Once I had embraced that premise, Kya’s world opened up for me. I could see through her eyes, hear her thoughts, and feel her emotions, a life defined by rejections and believing people just don’t stay. The ending, I admit, I did not see coming. But, I think it ended the only way it could have.  The good, the bad, the ugly...and the beautiful.	One person found this helpful
J. Melko	5.0 out of 5 stars	June 4, 2019	Kindle Edition	A Gorgeous, Gripping Mystery - and not just of a crime	Every once in a while,a book title will call out to me in its own form of poetry. I am sure this title calls out to others just as strongly as it did to me.  Only rarely, however, does the poetry remain consistent to the very last word.The Marsh Girl - Kya - is a mystery unto herself. How is it that a character can be thoroughly developed and described throughout hundreds of pages, yet remain inscrutable behind every word?Yes, the tale is of a possible crime.  A sheriff discovers a body and suspects a murder. The story interweaves the descriptions of  Kya and her life with the developments of the investigation and the traditional elements of an arrest and trial. And yes, that traditional story will nevertheless grip you and keep you devouring its arc as no other can.But interwoven with those dark threads are feathers - both literal and figurative - feathers of another story, feathers of a life so strangely different from that of any reader, feathers of a family of wilderness that drapes its wings around a little girl and protects her from human judgment. Those feathers only suggest the bird itself, never finally giving substance to the deeper reality of its nature. Kya is that bird, and while we can observe her and admire her, we can never completely understand her. Just as Kya’s books introduce her readers to a complex world beyond their superficial glances, Delia Owens gives us the Marsh Girl as a poetic invitation to experience nature as friend and family.

Sbelle4	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 9, 2019	Kindle Edition	The Marsh Is a Beautiful Character in this Book	This is a beautiful and haunting novel; both life-affirming and heartbreaking.  Catherine Danielle Clark, aka Kya, is abandoned in severe poverty in a marsh near the fictional village of Barkley Cove, North Carolina as a child and uses her wits to survive.  She grows up as one with the marsh life, although she is not quite feral due to her upbringing by her mother to the age of six and the help of a few friends who take her under their wing.  Although shunned and scorned by the villagers who call her “the marsh girl” Kya is extremely intelligent in spite of having attended only one day of school in her life.  She eventually earns a living in a most surprising way given her lack of formal education.  The best thing about this novel is that Kya is never a caricature; she is clever beyond the ability of everyone, including the reader, to fully grasp until the end of the novel.  This novel is a sad reminder that isolation and abandonment in early childhood can weave itself into a person’s DNA in a way that is very difficult to fully heal.  One of my favorite things about this novel is how the marsh land and marsh life become a character in the book and how Kya seems to take her life lessons from the behavior of the insects and birds.  If you had been abondoned by your parents at a young age in profound isolation what else would you have to teach you?  If you haven't read this book and are at all interested I say take a chance on it!	One person found this helpful
Msanza	3.0 out of 5 stars	June 11, 2019	Kindle Edition	Wanted to love it, BUT...	Why was this book ranked so highly? Most likely the good reviews were from Reese Witherspoon fans or those who enjoy romantic fairy tales.  Where the Crawdads sing is a fairy tale. This NC reader needed  to suspend my belief too many times to keep reading and I only finished it because it was a book group read.

Bibsisis	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 8, 2019	Kindle Edition	Great book	Where the Crawdads Sing is the most beautiful and highly interesting book I've read in a long time.  I would call it literary fiction about life in the marshes and swamps off the North Carolina coast, not far from the Outer Banks.  While I've been to those specific places, I had no knowledge of people who live on the outskirts who are shunned and discriminated against by most of their neighbors in the more heavily-populated towns.  The story revolves around a six year old girl, a marsh-dweller, who is abandoned by her family, actually through no fault of their own.  The fact is one of the harshness and financial poverty of being a marsh dweller.  How attuned to every aspect of the marsh the little girl is gives one pause for wonder.  How she knows how to survive, dependent on the marsh and all its treasures for food, ways of earning pennies to survive, is more than amazing.  She's obviously a bright child who remembers what she learned from her mother and a special brother.  As she grows up struggling, other characters emerge from the fringes of the marsh and small towns whom she learns, gradually, to trust.  There's mystery here which is solved in a startling conclusion.  There's love and heartbreak and false accusations and, eventually, truth.  The descriptive writing about the marsh denizens--the wildlife and fish and animals--is as beautiful as poetry in its lyrical style.  And, oh, the detailed information about every aspect of the marsh!  I never wanted the book to end.	One person found this helpful
Secretcitynative	3.0 out of 5 stars	July 15, 2019	Kindle Edition	Somewhat disappointed	Certainly a well-written story of loneliness, abandonment, social prejudice, and love.  But it struck me as more of an ecological overview of the Carolina marshland that one could find in almost any coastal nature magazine. The story was simple and almost Cinderella - one that could be told in a novella rather than being drawn out into unnecessary and often boring drivel.  As a Romance novel, I suppose it is OK - but I am not a fan of that genre.  Apparently, Reese and Ophra are.On Edit: After sleeping overnight immediately after finishing the book I awoke realizing that some of my dreams wandered toward questions not completely answered in black and white.  The death of Chase, for example.  What really happened?  I had Chases' wife pegged as the bad girl or perhaps another yet to be introduced female conquest he had wronged.  Perhaps the story had more of an impact on me than I originally thought?  I do know that the bias of social class and color were strong during the period covered in the story because Kya was my age!  It is unfortunate that some of these feelings are still dominant today.  Please don't let my male bias keep you from reading this story.  It is very moving and symbolic.	One person found this helpful
Erica Y.	2.0 out of 5 stars	December 8, 2018	Kindle Edition	Boxcar Children for Adults	This reads like a less plausible version of the Boxcar Children.  At least, the first 30% of the book does--I didn't finish it.  It is populated by a cast of one-dimensional characters.  The plot is preposterous and melodramatic.  Added a star because it is a first novel and the writing is better than most popular fiction.	6 people found this helpful
T. Jones	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 25, 2019	Kindle Edition	A book to fall into	I understand those who felt the book was unrealistic, but I loved it.  It's a novel and I read it as such - not all novels are meant to be accurate - it's like saying The Lord of the Flies is unrealistic and therefore not a good book! As an academic, I read a lot of academic books that are based on real events, so I guess I was looking for something that I could literally fall into and escape reality for a little while.  This was that book.  I fell into the first few pages and was lost within the pages from beginning to end.  It is beautifully written, that weaves together a crime story, with a romance, with a story of survival.  I just let myself enjoy it and couldn't put it down.  It is a great summer read that captivates you and keeps you reading.  I read A LOT of novels, many of which I quickly forget when I finish reading them.  This is one that will stay with me for a long time, not because it made me think deeply, but it made me feel deeply.	One person found this helpful
Penny	3.0 out of 5 stars	January 21, 2019	Kindle Edition	A good, biologically-accurate yarn about loneliness, longing, survival, resilience and prejudice.	If you enjoy nature, biology, poetry and a good yarn with a light smattering of mystery, Where the Crawdads Sing might be your thing. (Crawdads are freshwater crayfish.)The book is American author Delia Owens' first novel. She previously co-authored three or four nonfiction books about her life as a wildlife scientist in Africa, which explains why she writes so authoritatively about the birds, plants and various other goggas of the marshlands of the North Carolina coast in her novel.Where the Crawdads Sing is about Kya Clark (aka Marsh Girl) who grows up largely alone when her family abandons her and becomes the prime suspect when her former boyfriend is found dead in the marsh. It's more of a coming-of-age story than a thriller. I loved the backdrop, and Kya's fascination and closeness with nature. In places, I envied her solitude, but it's a story of loneliness, longing, survival, resilience and prejudice.	2 people found this helpful
Reader	2.0 out of 5 stars	April 14, 2019	Kindle Edition	NOT A FIVE STAR BOOK	This was a notably uneven read.  The first half of the book is, actually, well written and enjoyable.  The story when told from the point of view of the child-protagonist had charm, was poignant if unrealistic, and flowed.  However, that was about all worth reading.  Once the author was required to "advance the plot" ... the writing became forced.  The language changed from Southern dialect to "proper" English and was stiff and awkward -- particularly in dialogue.  The only thing that saved the book were the courtroom scenes -- nothing special at that, but a tolerable cliche.  The "final twist" was absolutely predictable, having been pointedly signaled from the beginning of the book.  All in all, a real disappointment.	2 people found this helpful
L. Williams	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 31, 2019	Kindle Edition	A tender coming of age story with a murder mystery	I loved this book. At first when I read the synopsis of what it was about, I thought, hmm well maybe.  Then I saw the great reviews, and tried to get it at one of our libraries. There was not a book to be had for a 50 mile radius of my city, when I can usually get any book in a day. So that convinced me to read it!  I ordered it in Kindle version on my iPad.The style of writing was good, character development good, and I learned a lot about the biology of the Marsh area as well.I won't tell what the story was about because other reviews tell that, but the ending had a twist that was very unexpected.A novel about relying on your own strength within, but the perils of what the lack of human interaction with others does to us.  It was a tender story about Kya's life, and her relationships with the outdoor Marsh world and the few people she let into her life, and how those relationships and her environment changed her as she grew up.It was a Book Club read for a group of friends and most of us rated it a 10 out of 10, and it garnered great discussion.  I would highly recommend it.	One person found this helpful
Georgia	5.0 out of 5 stars	November 29, 2018	Kindle Edition	Beautifully written	Delia,  So proud of a UGA graduate and Georgia native for writing  such a lovely book.  Loved your portrayal of the Marsh girl and felt whispers of Harper Lee and To Kill a Mockingbird in it in a modern way with all of the scientific information and a different kind of justice.  Your description of isolation and how she handled seemed so real.  It rates a high score in that I had no trouble with willing suspension of disbelief.  Your knowledge of the marshes and the life they give to everything else was amazing.  I thought you handled the environmental debate in a smooth and tactful way with no preaching.  Now everytime I go to the Low Country or to Thomasville, I will think of this great book.  Do hope you will write more.	2 people found this helpful
John	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 24, 2018	Kindle Edition	Truly Outstanding	Surprisingly, I feel this is one of the best books I've read in years, and one of the best books I've read, period. You know the book ads that come up when you open your Kindle? I always ignore them. The name of the book caught my eye, I was intrigued about the meaning. That led me to some reviews. I was afraid it was going to be a chick book, but someone compared it to the book, "To Kill A Mockingbird". High praise indeed. I took a chance. Then, I couldn't put it down. Beautifully written, and an incredible story. I'm writing this review in the hopes that it helps convince someone to read the book, like a fellow reviewer helped convince me.	3 people found this helpful
Paul R DesRoches	4.0 out of 5 stars	April 18, 2019	Kindle Edition	Compelling and richly diverse in character development and plot intricacies	The only thing I disliked about this book was the denouement at the end of the plot, but I cannot comment on why because it would lead to a spoiler.  I thought the writing style was quite polished and the character developments, though few in number, were pretty well thought out, leading to a plot that was both surprising and unexpected.  I loved the apparent knowledge ostensibly proffered by the author regarding the low country and its diverse flora and fauna which were more than incidental to the meaning of the book overall.  Although the development of the protagonist was a touch unlikely given the limited resources available to her, the story uplifts the reader in many parts, while in other parts there is a shocking disparity in the nature of the action in the story.  So, the author intertwines various values along with the hopes and the disappointments of the protagonist as she toils to find the meaning in her life, and her success is readily admired by the reader.  The writing quality is top notch, filled with quality metaphors, similes, and constructs of language that are indicative of the maturity and experience of the author herself, an acclaimed PhD who studies anthropological questions in her other very real job.

IllinoisGirl	3.0 out of 5 stars	May 9, 2019	Kindle Edition	Slow Pace	More 3.5 than 3. The writing was solid, but this book dragged. One reason was the constant time switching. I'd be immersed in one story, then the book would abruptly jump ahead or jump backward. It was distracting, and I couldn't help but feel it was a device to quicken the pace. It didn't work. The story itself is odd. Spoiler alert: A child surviving alone in a swamp while the entire town is aware of it, AND her mother and mother's family is aware that she is in dire straits, too, but does nothing to help her. Honestly, once the trial was over and I saw there were another 35 pages to go, I skimmed the inevitable, predictable ending because, let's face it, Chase Andrews wasn't the type of guy to go wandering around the marsh alone for no reason, nor was he the type of guy who'd decide to climb the water tower to be alone. Someone had to be there with him, and only one person made sense. Of course, we never got a look at his friends. His wife was a fact not a person in this book. Most of the other characters appeared to be right out of central casting, from the violent father to the crazy Southern mom, the hicks in the town, the noble boyfriend, the self-educated march girl... Nuff said.	One person found this helpful
RCB	1.0 out of 5 stars	September 24, 2019	Hardcover	worst book I've read in a long time	This book was a huge disappointment.  The plot premise and events repeatedly defy common sense, and the characters' emotions are stereotypical, one-note, and/or saccharine.  Dialogue is unrealistic; thank goodness, Kya's isolation means there's not much of it.  The so-called murder "mystery" has an obvious solution.  The poetry that appears with increasing frequency is cringe-worthy and a lame excuse for poor character development.  The author occasionally pens an evocative turn-of-phrase, but the lyrical bits aren't worth it.	3 people found this helpful
Jill V	4.0 out of 5 stars	March 3, 2019	Kindle Edition	An Impressive First Novel, Flaws and All	This novel caters to a wide audience, but in doing so it travels from the sublime to the ridiculous back to the sublime. An uneven work, it sometimes reads like a young adult novel with lots of coming of age hormones and melodrama; but it also is a beautiful work of art depicting the pain of loneliness and and the consequences of reclusive behavior.  At the age of six, the heroine, Kya, was abandoned by her family and left alone to survive in the backwoods’ marshes of North Carolina in the 1950’s. Time after time, human beings have disappointed her, so she finds solace in the natural world of the marshes. Living on the margins of society, she is treated like the town pariah. Her mistrust of people and her lack of self-esteem isolate her physically and emotionally. Her plight wrung the empathy right out of me. When a town’s young man, a former athlete, mysteriously falls off a large tower, Kya comes under suspicion. What happened to her family and the athlete create quite a page turner. However, this novel begs for its readers’ willing suspension of disbelief. If you can get beyond some unbelievable plot points and a corny trial, you will not only learn a ton about marshes and the sex lives of critters but also about the similarity between animal and human behavior. This is the author’s first novel, and it is an impressive first product.	One person found this helpful
Zuri	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 4, 2019	Kindle Edition	Beautiful writing, sad story.	I read the 2-star reviews and got what I wanted: views from readers who know the North Carolina coast and probably the people who live there. Some insisted that the dialect was incorrect and also some distances to towns. I am across the pond in South Africa, not knowing that coast ... yet enjoyed the story so much that I have to give it 5 stars. The sad little figure of a girl, Kya, left to fend for herself, and the beauty of the marshlands is so descriptive that I literally found myself in that mysterious place. The author has a great and flowing writing style. Not knowing the North Carolina coast, of course, I assumed that the author knew exactly what she was talking about. Maybe not, according to her critics. In any case, I enjoyed the book very much -- until the very end. The 5 stars are for the excellent writing, which drew me in and held me. About mistakes about places and small facts (according to some reviews) I cannot comment on. Just one criticism:  the conclusion. Okay, SPOILER ALERT: if you are contemplating buying this book, stop reading here! I do not understand how, in the trial, Kya was never called upon to answer questions, I do not understand how she could have disguised herself, made that rather incredible trip  (read it for yourself), and how this timid girl could have pulled off what she did. How? How did she convince Chase to meet her ... ?  Did I miss a vital clue as to how she did it? So for me the end was not really credible ... but then, if not, what did happen to Chase?

J.A. Cobra	3.0 out of 5 stars	June 18, 2019	Kindle Edition	If Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s “Emile” were “Emily” instead...	Kya is one with nature, not spoiled by the superficiality of society.  She spurns school after one day because some students made fun of her, and she chooses to be educated by nature instead (save for a few years with Tate, who teaches her to read). She is the perfect woman— beautiful and somehow alluring in spite of her having acquired no grooming skills becoming of a woman in the 1960s, and healthy, in spite of having been abandoned at the age of eleven but also never having visited a hospital in her life.But leaving the progressive, anti-society premise aside, you would be mistaken if you expect to encounter a story here; this no story. This is wonderfully crafted prose, beautifully depicted scenery, a smattering of poetry, and a throwaway murder mystery that gives the semblance of a plot and climax, given that its resolution is predictable in one sense and non-existent in another.What I enjoyed about this novel was the prose. Owens thoroughly crafts an emotionally compelling world and an equally compelling protagonist to wander that world. What I did not enjoy about this novel is that all the protagonist does is wander. She does not fight for anything, not even her beloved marsh when the superficial society threatens to take it from her. She struggles for nothing. The men come to her, love her, and leave her. Her means of supporting herself comes to her effortlessly. I will stop short of spoiling the main “plot,” but it does suffice to say that her darkest hours come and go with no event, and her entire life seems to be a metaphor for that.Do not be fooled by the notion that this is a coming of age story. She never comes of age. She is the same at eleven years old as she will be at sixty-four. Also, do not be fooled by the notion that this is a murder mystery. There is no mystery. There is no a-ha moment. No one is particularly clever in the resolution of the mystery, and too, the mystery takes up so little of the narrative that it really does not have to be here. The society is indicted at the outset of the narrative, and whatever you are supposed to learn about them from the verdict does not change this indictment. Further more, whatever you think the outcome of the trial will be, you will probably be right.Read this for the beauty of the writing, for beauty’s sake. That is certainly all you are supposed to get from this narrative.	2 people found this helpful
Kindle Customer	2.0 out of 5 stars	May 26, 2019	Kindle Edition	Doesn't love up to the hype. Totally agree!!  BORING, BORING, BORING!!!	This book was incredibly boring. Endless descriptions of a marsh. One would have sufficed! Endless descriptions of flora and fauna. Let's face it a marsh is a marsh. A child surviving on her own with no idea how to cook or clean, really???? Time travel?? Going from the East Coast to Atlanta or Charlotte in an hour?!? Unbelievable!! The child learned to read and write with only 1(one) hour in a school, c'mon. I won't go into details on the courtroom trual. What would be the point! Totally boring and redundant!

EllEmm	3.0 out of 5 stars	April 26, 2019	Kindle Edition	Beautiful, but a fairy tale	There is much to like about this book. Unlike others, though, I thought the descriptions of the marsh were the best character, so to speak. The people and the story were just too unrealistic for me. It was as though Owens didn't really trust her characters, so Kya didn't just survive abandonment by her entire crappy family, she turned out gorgeous and brilliant. Not only did she learn to read late, she picked it up quickly and was soon reading Einstein-level texts. She wasn't just a keen observer of her world, she became a renowned naturalist. And on and on. When Kya had to go on trial, I actually wondered why she didn't check a few law books out of the library and represent herself. There just seemed to be nothing she couldn't do. Me, I would have thought it remarkable enough that an abandoned child survived to adulthood. I liked it enough; it just didn't rock my world.There are a lot of trite characters: the drunken, cruel father and the dreamy, artistic mother, the kindly black couple who keep a distant watch on her, the two well-born suitors who come from the right side of the tracks. (I think one has blonde hair and one dark, but cannot remember.)  I have to admit that at some point I wondered if Owens didn't have a canny eye for a movie production.	One person found this helpful
Kindle Customer	5.0 out of 5 stars	June 4, 2019	Kindle Edition	Extraordinary Tale	Must be the most creative and interesting story I've ever read : sadness, abuse, neglect, survival, naturalism, love, hate, prejudice, ignorance, jealousy, sex, murder, mystery this has it all. A young preteen girl raised in the marsh and slowly abandoned by her family until only she and her alcoholic WW2 veteran with an injured leg and pension stayed on his family land in an old snack w/o running water, electricity or telephone. No car - just a small boat and motor to traverse the waters to nearby very small town.Finally be too leaves - read or alive she never knows, but  as a little girl who only went to school one day and his out from truant officers forever after - against all odds, she survives. She learns from nature and survives. Eventually taught to read and count past 29 by a nice young high school boy she reads generously until she's an expert. Her trials of love, abandonment,and survival are gripping and inspiring. If you are ya real man who can cry openly, don't read this extraordinary tale.	One person found this helpful
Julie Bishop	5.0 out of 5 stars	December 30, 2018	Hardcover	Beautiful hardly describes this book.	This book is now on my list of all time favorites.  It is sometimes heartbreakingly brutal and other times as soft and soulful as one could imagine.  If only one could find books this good on a regular basis...they only come around once in a great while.  It sang to me - it made me laugh and made me cry.  I loved every minute of the way this writer strings together words.  The main character's relationship with nature is like a true North, steering the reader toward the pain and truths in this book with that easy southern way.  While she paddles the marsh, the reader travels through it with her.  You feel it.  You hear it.  You smell it.  It is amazing how this author's descriptions truly transport you to another place and time.  You get lost - which is exactly what I expect from an amazing book.  This one will stay in my collection.	2 people found this helpful

When I reached 67% I wanted to slow my reading down because I didn't want this book to end.  However, the story was so lovely and gripping that I couldn't stop.  I finished the last page with a sigh and then thought about the book the rest of the day.  From the first paragraph, I fell in love with this story.  Kya is a wonder and you will be at turns delighted with her, terrified for her, and filled with sorrow for her.  The weaving together of human nature and animal nature and the lessons learned from living in the marsh were a wonder. I cannot recommend this book enough.  It is a book I will read again since now that I know the outcome, I can go back and just read for the beauty of her descriptions.

Taffodil	4.0 out of 5 stars	January 8, 2019	Kindle Edition	Touching lyrical story with a twist	I enjoyed reading this at a 5 star level because I have taxing job and to be carried away by a story that I only get to read before bed that is written well overall in which I learn something and feel emotionally touched yet don't have to work to hard to access, is such a gift!  However, I give it 4 stars because I agree with other reviewers that there were some unrealistic aspects to this story but perhaps not for the same reasons.  If only we really knew how many latchkey homeless children were out there left to fend for themselves in this wealthy country with so much judgement for the unfortunates, (and I am NOT a bleeding heart liberal) we might not be so judgemental about this aspect of the story.  While some of the details might be odd, such as learning to read so quickly so well and the stark change in her ability to speak so eloquently, her life still speaks to the rising spirit of the human spirit from dire circumstances to create a meaningful life. While many have picked away at the details of the marsh and the south, knowing nothing of these things, I found such a different world very fascinating and enjoyed the word pictures of deep nature the author described.  I didn't love the ending, but I also understood the desperation and survival need that required such action. I recommend this read for the heart, not the perfect detail.	One person found this helpful
Kindle Customer	4.0 out of 5 stars	July 28, 2019	Kindle Edition	A wonderful first novel, but not without some difficulties.	A genuine pleasure to read, one of those rare books that truly educate us about the world right in front of us that we know nothing about.  The richness and beauty of the coastal marsh, and the deep intelligence and sensitivity of the protagonist because she has immersed itself in it, hold lessons for us all.  A striking!y original debut.The author has room to grow.  Her characters are vivid and believable, but their interactions are often clumsily described and hence unsatisfying.  The protagonist behaves at times in a curiously weak manner inconsistent with all the author has taught us about her.  Finally, the author seems a bit geographically challenged.  She has the coastal people traveling all the way to Asheville for city services, as if the much larger cities of Raleigh, Charlotte and Norfolk were not much closer.All in all, however you will be glad you read this book and will wish more novels were so beautiful.

Lisa BoBisa	2.0 out of 5 stars	May 24, 2019	Kindle Edition	Starts good, then fizzles	Some of the dialogue in the beginning is forced and unnatural, and some of the characters were stereotypical, but I was willing to ignore that for awhile. However, the author is apparently unable to read a map. In North Carolina, Asheville is the state's most famous town, but it is SEVEN HOURS of interstate driving from the coast. Back in the 50's and 60's, and/or with kids in the car, it would be even longer. Plus, in the 59's and 69's, it was a fairly small town. People at the coast would never have "run over to Asheville" for anything, as the characters in this book did at least 3 times before I gave up. Going to Asheville would not have been a 2-day, weekend trip from the coast, either, as happened once. Nevermind the fact that to get to Asheville from the coast, those characters would have had to drive THROUGH at least 2 bigger cities. Ridiculous. So many other little things were of about the setting and how people talk, but this was the one that was unforgivable for me.	One person found this helpful
R. Black	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 7, 2019	Hardcover	Hope this book becomes a movie!	I really enjoyed this book. I picked it for its great reviews and favorable commentary from many book clubs. Living in the south myself, I was intrigued by the story’s location and wanted an enjoyable, “take-me-away”, poolside read. The plot and characters are well developed throughout the book and the further I read, I found myself feeling empathy for the story’s main character. The circumstances as they unfold, made me recognize just how important a person’s upbringing and early years are, and even more importantly, how formative they can be as we move from a child into an adult. The author also does a great job of helping you visualize the surroundings of where the story takes place, and in an interesting way, weaves her knowledge of nature and the natural environment into the story. While the beginning of the book brings to light some sad and difficult issues, the story itself evolves over time to focus on the rich personal relationships that are formed, shining a light on the resilience of the human spirit. The book kept my interest throughout and provided enough plot twists to keep me guessing and turning another page. Gladly recommend it be added to your reading list.	One person found this helpful
Mary Clark	4.0 out of 5 stars	November 10, 2019	Kindle Edition	If only she had gone where the crawdads sing	This book poses some great questions, but also has some major flaws. In lyrical language, the child Kya's relationship with the natural world conveys a sense of wonder and appreciation of life. This is the best part of the book, showing how we are renewed and supported by our natural environment. However, this story is set against a gloomy plot. Some of the main characters are vibrant, but others are hollow and vague.Two books are being written. One is the story of a child growing up despite a minimum of parenting but with the comfort and lessons of the natural world, who suffers abuse but finds help from other outcasts and compassionate people. Dawn and gifts. The other story is a crass justification for people behaving badly. Love and death are reduced to a non-human level of understanding. People who have good character are sent into the background. Even the beautiful is dreadful. Twilight and fireflies.The book tries to have it both ways: that the child Kya matured and excelled intellectually because of a few relationships with other people and with nature, but also never really developed emotionally, morally and ethically for the same reasons. This doesn't make sense. Kya is shown examples of morality and ethics in her relationships with those few who did help her. There are lessons in compassion and non-violent resilience in the marsh life as well as the cruel ones. She has the ability to read and write. She does reflect, which is essential to making moral and ethical decisions. She relies on certain people, knows they care for her and will accept her gifts.Do the repeated hardships keep her from maturing as a human being, or does choose which examples and lessons to follow? Either way, she has a thin excuse for the actions she takes with the man who loves her and the man who threatens her. What we're left with is someone who only understands human behavior well enough to mimic it, and only understands the natural world well enough to mimic it. But that is not the dreaming, loving, artistic and forgiving person who appears in some parts of the book. So which is it?After showing growth from experience and reflection, the story reverts to an old paradigm, perhaps the fatal flaw or a last century psychology, rather than moving forward into greater understanding, that is, humanity.  That would be going far beyond, where the crawdads sing.

swiminakilt	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 30, 2019	Hardcover	A wonderful read	I enjoyed this book because it did the one thing that reels me in.  It builds.  You grow to want to know more and more about every character.  Kya was the one character I could not picture which really interested me.  A recent review I read spoke about how this story is not realistic.  I disagree completely.  I had a friend not go to school for a year and about the same amount of effort went into finding him.  As for the character not really getting sick, when you aren't around other people it's pretty difficult to get sick!  Now to what I truly loved.  It is the knowledge of nature that makes this book amazing.  You have great characters, a great story being told back and forth from chapter to chapter.  But on one page it mentions the plover.  A plover is a bird that migrates further than any other bird.  Choosing that bird made it special for me as the story is about someone who never really leaves home.  There is so much more to this story than meets the eye and all of the nature is perfectly woven in.	One person found this helpful
seadreamart	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 8, 2019	Hardcover	Lyrical, Haunting and Beautiful	This was my first audible book.

I will never forget Kya and her haunting, beautiful story.  The parts about her connection to the birds, plants and animals in her marsh world were my favorite, but the mystery the author builds pulled me in too.  I looked forward to my commute to and from work every day so I could be immersed in this story. I entered my drive just as the last words were being read and it took me a few moments to recover thru the tears enough to get out of my car.

Book Addict	4.0 out of 5 stars	September 22, 2019	Hardcover	It's worth it to overlook the errors made by the editors	Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens sat on my book shelf for months waiting patiently until I had the time and inclination to read. Highly recommended from friends, the book remained unopened.Then I attended a writer's workshop with several successful authors. A question asked of a local North Carolina bestselling author resulted in a wave of comments raising disdain for the acclaimed novel.Guess what I did when I came home? Right. I opened the book and dug into it. Before I heard one more comment--negative or positive--I needed to determine for myself what I thought about the book.Once started, I had to finish. Good sign. The language of the naturalist captured me in its net. I lost myself in the descriptions of island life off the coast of North Carolina where even the tiniest of creatures and the most obscure of flora received its due. The character of Kaya broke my heart in its innocence and cheered my heart for her resilience. Tension builds throughout as she learns more about the world away from her narrow experience with human life forms after abandonment by those who should have taken care of her.But...and this is a big one...this book published by G.P. Putnam's Sons contains some errors that should make the editors at the big house cringe and rush to correct. The first one that disappointed me occurred while the police chief and deputy sit after a long day of detective work to figure out who murdered a local man. They are on the deck of their station facing the marsh and then the Atlantic Ocean beyond. The author writes that the two are drinking a beer while watching the sunset. I read the line to my husband and asked him to tell me the location of the novel. "California," he replied. You'd think. But no. A simple, silly mistake that should have been caught and corrected.Then there are multiple references to folks in this small community heading on over to Asheville, North Carolina, as if it's just a short jaunt. Once it's when the father needs to check on his disability payments. In another instance, a mother wants a special gift, but the Ace Hardware near the island didn't carry it so she drives over to Asheville . Sorry, but Asheville may be recognizable to the rest of the country, but anyone who knows the area knows two things. Asheville isn't a big city nor the closest one to the coast. Try Raleigh or Charlotte for checking in the with the VA. Same with the Ace Hardware. I don't think a busy struggling mother would drive more than three hundred miles for a toy when other larger cities are much closer. The critics at the writing conference where I first heard of this complaint speculated that the publishers wanted to use a popular town as reference. But anyone who knows the state at all knows that Asheville is the furthermost city from the coast located in the western part of North Carolina.Fiction elaborates, exaggerates, enhances, and embellishes reality. But if an author uses real places, facts and details should be accurate. I usually put down books that contain such blatant errors. Fortunately, Ms. Owens created such an otherwise compelling read, I forgave and forged ahead to the end. I don't blame her. I blame her editors and proofreaders. I recommend reading the book and ignoring the stupid errors. It's worth it and captures the life teeming on the sea shores in all its bizarre, beautiful, and horrific glory.Click here for Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens	
Tabitha	2.0 out of 5 stars	July 6, 2019	Kindle Edition	SPOILERS! Slow and mediocre	Where do I begin? The book tries way to hard to be overly descriptive to the point where I had to read certain passages multiple times to understand what it was trying to describe. Sometimes, it's good to let the reader imagine the environment by giving them a good description but without overdoing it so that they're left confused about the picture you're trying to paint. The first half of the book was slow and the story happened in small bits between large sections of fluff.After a very drawn out build-up, it comes to an unsatisfying conclusion which was predictable but also frustrating because it writes off murder nonchalantly and leaves the reader wondering why it's okay that the main character was allowed to get away with. The conclusion is plain abrupt and lacks conhesiveness.The plotline is at most mediocre and disguised beneath flowery language. I'm not sure why the book has become so popular but there's much better out there to spend your time on.	2 people found this helpful
Lewis Greenwald	1.0 out of 5 stars	July 12, 2019	Kindle Edition	Saccharine Goo	If you like young adult romance fiction, soap operas, and/or melodramas, you will love this book.  I found it to be "sappy."  The characters are two-dimensional.  The bad guys are too bad; the good guys are too saintly.  It seems as though every noun comes with a string of adjectives (Mark Twain advised "When in doubt about an adjective, leave it out").  It won't be long before the cover of the book says "Now a major motion picture."  I suppose that I'm a cynical, old curmudgeon.  If you are too, then find something with more substance to read.	3 people found this helpful
Patricia S. Burgess	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 17, 2019	Kindle Edition	Most inspiring and just plain lovely!	Having spent much time around the swamps of coastal North Carolina, I found the scenery descriptions to be glorious.  I could feel the humidity, hear the insects, and smell the glorious of swamp critters and decaying vegetation, and feel the pain of a little girl forced to grow up much to fast.  This 6-year old girl broke my heart with the gentle way that she accepted her fate in life and just carried on doing the best that she could.  The kindly boat store keeper and his wife earned my deepest respect, while the townspeople challenged me to love them in the way that they treated her through so many years.  The friendship that she made with the boy who ultimately broke her heard and destroyed much of her heart and claim for better things.  She is a true hero in the way that she hung onto the land, her run-down home, and the little boat making them all work for her all on her own.  In this day when so many of our young people are eager to do things the easy way, she, though doomed, made her own way.  And, what a way it was!  Her collections, drawings and eager research even though she had never been to school were nothing short of amazing.  The one day she want to school just broke my heart.  But, I found glory in the way she triumphed.  I gloried in the way her friend sent off her drawings and the results thereof.  I shed tears at the way she fixed up the little house and her boat and the success that came her way.  This is a story of hope if there ever was one.  This is also a story of facing challenges and not giving up:  never giving up.  I was inspired.  As a Southern woman, I yearned for her to have the best.  Once I began reading, I could not put it down.  You must read it.  I promise that you will be moved as well.

Jackie Sweeney	2.0 out of 5 stars	April 24, 2019	Kindle Edition	???	It must be me as I did not like this book. From one unbelievable tale to another. A little girl in a town with other people, left to her own devices at 6 and no one takes her in? Then she has an affair with the town quarterback who promises her the moon then reneges but tries to keep the affair going even after he marries another? The swamp kid who gets a college degree but can't forget the "Marsh Girl"? I like a good fantasy as well as the next person but this was like outer space. For all the rave reviews I was really looking forward to this book and was so disappointed.	2 people found this helpful
Amazon Customer	5.0 out of 5 stars	October 10, 2019	Kindle Edition	Where the Crawdads Sing is not what I expected.  It was great.	I just finished reading this book that I had put off reading for months and months.  It just did not appeal to me.  I had read the synopsis, and it still did not say "read me."  I kept thinking it was going to be like "Before We Were Yours" which I totally detested, but finished it somehow.  I guess I was looking for something to read, and I saw there were 23,000+ reviews, so I got the sample.  I buzzed through the sample.  I already had a hard copy of the book, but I have gotten so used to reading on my Paperwhite, I just went ahead and one-clicked it.  It really got so good and I found myself driving home for lunch to read a couple of chapters.  Then I put the Kindle app on my phone and I found myself reading at work.  I never do this!  Also, I got up earlier to read and of course would read until I fell asleep at night.  It was just so good.  I am trying to decide what makes this book stand out from others.  Not certain if it was the story line, the writing, the characters, setting or what.  I briefly glanced over some of the 1 star reviews.  OK.  Everyone has his own opinion, and I have mine.  I guess comparing "Where the Crawdads Sing" with "Before We were Yours" the "Crawdads" writing was so descriptive and I could just see the setting and the characters that I got to know.  I loved Jumpin and Mable.  Whereas the "Before" writing could have been that of an 8th grader.  I am now going to sit back and think about the whole story and try to figure out why I enjoyed this book so much.	
The Brown Bookloft	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 23, 2019	Kindle Edition	Literary Fiction at its Best	Summary: When Kya is six years old, she watches her mother walk away. Most of her siblings drift away, too, unable to live any longer with their drunken, abusive father. Kya’s older brother sticks around just long enough to teach her some basic survival skills, then he, too, vanishes. Kya learns to live around her father, vanishing into the woods and marsh to avoid his beatings. After a while, he also takes off. Kya is now ten years old and all alone in the North Carolina marsh.With the kindness and friendship of the few people she comes in contact with, Kya manages to eke out a living selling shellfish. She wanders, collecting feathers, shells and plants. She meets a boy a few years older than herself who teaches her to read and write. Tate is kind and patient, and a gentle, youthful romance blossoms between them. Kya no longer feels so alone.But in the town, the adults scorn her and call her dirty “Marsh Girl”. The group of popular kids think it’s fun sport to frighten Kya. When one of them takes things too far, there are horrific consequences.Comments: I finally gave up on waiting for Where the Crawdads Sing at the library and purchased a copy. It was worth every penny. The lyrical language and descriptions drew me into Kya’s environment. I heard the shore birds, felt the spray and salt on my skin, the humidity dampening my hair. The author obviously knows how to write about natural settings. But the characters are what really pulled me deeply into the novel. They just felt so real. I read this book in a single day. I just couldn’t put it down.Highly recommended for readers of Literary FictionNote: This book is not a mystery or historical fiction. Those are misleading genre labels. It has a bit of a mystery in it with some courtroom drama, but that is not its essence. The time period is 1940’s-present day. The time period is there not to emphasize historical facts. but to give credence to the story.	
Lila Faye	5.0 out of 5 stars	October 7, 2018	Kindle Edition	I really liked it!	I read a few of the other reviews before writing this.  I have to say, some people put way too much work into it.  "It doesn't make sense" , "It's not possible".  It's fiction!  Dust off that imagination and lighten up.  I don't read books to be so critical of them.  I read for entertainment and pleasure.  So the author stretches a little.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I cared about the characters and I loved the ending.  The trial was not dry and too detailed like other books I have read.  All in all, a really good book!	3 people found this helpful
Chelsea usher	2.0 out of 5 stars	July 18, 2019	Kindle Edition	beautifully written, but not at all interesting (IMO)	This novel was selected for me as part of an impromptu book club. If you’ve seen my usual book choices, you can see that it doesn’t exactly fit in with my book choices, but I wanted to give it a fair shake. I read this as a kindle read so as I provide this review, I’ll be giving percentages instead of page counts to talk about how I felt as I read along.To be 100% honest, I almost DNF’d this book around 23% through. I was BORED. I get the appeal of a girl and a place. I truly do. But that’s not my story and there are too many books on my tbr that ARE my story. But, it was for book club, so I kept going. There was an element of crime drama and the non linear storytelling that I kinda liked, so regardless of whether I liked Kya or not, I kept reading.But then it got so, so, so predictable that by 50% I did DNF it. I was totally done with it, book club be damned. I was 100% sure I knew how the crime plot was going to shake out, I didn’t have any strong tie to Kya or Chase or Tate or anyone else, except for maybe Jumpin.The one thing I didn’t count on was being shamed for DNFing it at book club. I thought I had enough to speak on when we started talking about it… (50% is a LOT to talk about AND I’m an English major and an English teacher tyvm) I guess by me not finishing it in the first place I was bashing the pick of it? Or maybe I made my opinion of it too well known, but anyway, I was made to feel guilty enough that I went home and stewed over finishing it so much that I did just that!I finished the dang book. And you know what, it was exactly what I thought it was going to be. The crime plot shook out exactly as expected, the good guy was the good guy, the bad guy was the bad guy, the the marsh was the marsh.Here’s the good:Delia Owens is a beautiful descriptive writer. Her description is out of this world. She created the marsh as it’s own character and imagery is her god damn forte. Holy cow can she paint a picture.Here’s the not so good:It felt predictable from the start.Maybe it was supposed to. Maybe you’re supposed to guess it from the beginning. This wasn’t for me.I just felt like I wasted my time. Like I said in the beginning… There are too many books on my TBR for me to feel guilty over DNFing a book.	
Pati Mooring	5.0 out of 5 stars	July 23, 2019	Kindle Edition	Even the quiet ones can surprise you	I had a lot of trouble getting into this book.  I read it for my book club and I'm glad that I did in the end. It was a slow start for me, but I stuck with it.Spoilers:Kya was just a young girl when everyone in her family left her. I don't quite understand it, but I have never been in an abusive family. First her mom, then her sisters, then her brothers and finally her dad. Kya raised herself. Thankfully, she had a little help when she was really young. The grocery lady, Jumpin, Tate and  Mabel. These people helped her get by when she had no money, needed supplies, gas for her boat; a Godsend for her. Her best friends were the gulls and she learned to outwit everyone that came looking for her. As Tate taught her to read and write, she began to label her specimines, feathers, shells, etc.  She dated Tate for a beat and then he went off to college and didn't return for several years. While he was gone, Kya tried building a relationship with Chase only to find out he had a whole life outside the marsh all the when continuing to tell her he wanted her to be his wife and he was going to build a home for them. Until one day, she found his wedding announcement and called off the relationship. A while later,  Chase tried to rape and assault her and she beat him up and ran to hide. He tried locating her but she always hid from him. Well in Oct, she was asked to meet her publisher in a nearby city and while she was gone, Chase ended up dead. The police tried to pin the murder on Kya but her alibi was solid. After spending 2 months in jail, she decided to again have a relationship with Tate the only person she ever loved. They got married and Kya continued making reference texts about the marsh and secretly writing poetry and submitting it to the town paper. Later after Kya died, Tate found a secret hidy hole under the stove and was amazed at what he found. Kya was a smart woman who knew how to take care of herself.	
Duane M. Timm	5.0 out of 5 stars	October 13, 2019	Kindle Edition	Surviving	Talk about surviving!  Kia, the 'Marsh Girl' was indeed a survivor.  Her father was an alcoholic and abusive.  One day her mother put on her fake alligator shoes and left.  Gradually all the siblings took off and Kia was left to fend for herself, surviving on lumpy grits! One day of school had her saying, "Never Again!"  She rarely went into the small village, she was thought of as white trash, "That Marsh Girl".  A friend had a service station for boaters and she harvested mussels and sold them to him to buy gas for her boat.  She used the boat to observe the beauty of nature, and spent a lot of the day feeding and enjoying her gulls.Kia became friendly with two young men.  One was special, but left to attend college.  The other was crazy about her, but was already engaged to a city girl.  He ends up murdered in the marsh and Kia is accused! The trial and Kia's unexpected talent for illustrating and writing books about the Marsh (birds, plants, etc.) make this book very entertaining.Not surprising, Delia Owens was also a loner in South Africa.  Apparently this makes her writing authentic and believable.  It is a wonder that Kia survived; however, that is the only world she knew.  A trip into the city was enough to get her back to her marsh as soon as possible.When we go through life taking things for granted, it takes a book like this to make us stop to think.  Could I be a survivor?	
Roxanne Coats McDonald	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 25, 2019	Audible Audiobook	Where Crawdads Sing Makes the Grade!	This book was very interesting and beautifully written. It draws you into our heroine’s life and you become intrigued at her loneliness, love of the marsh and her survival instincts. Many reviewers question the reality of the plot since the heroine is uneducated and naive to the ways of the world.In my opinion, a 5 star book should be able to draw the reader into the storyline and keep his/her interested and wanting more. The reader should think about the book when not actually reading it. The reader should either not be able to put the book down and or longs to start turning those pages again. The plot and characters should be complicated with twists and surprises. It should have a strong message which stays with the reader after the conclusion of the reading material. “Where The Crawdads Sing” offered all this and more to Yours Truly and so I am giving the book 5 stars and an A from me.

susan k.	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 27, 2019	Hardcover	This book is hard to put down!	This book is very evocative-- with lots of beautiful description, it really brings the North Carolina marshlands to life. The protagonist in the novel, Kya, only attends school for one day and she is a member of a large, neglectful, and totally dysfunctional family.  Having just read the memoir "Educated", the true story of Tara Westover, I was struck by the similarities. Tara was "homeschooled", but the "education" she received was one-sided and biased and full of stunning holes.  For instance, she had never heard of the Holocaust and was not aware of the civil rights movement. In contrast, Kya's family simply abandoned her, having taught her nothing but how to dig for mussels and oysters and how to fish. She isn't educated until her first love interest teaches her to read."Where the Crawdads Sing" is a mystery--it begins with the death of a man who we later learn was murdered--but the more important part of the book is watching Kya grow and learn. It's a great read, and hard to put down.	One person found this helpful
Louise D. Somes	5.0 out of 5 stars	June 29, 2019	Hardcover	Mesmerizingly beautiful portrait of wildlife and humanity	I just finished reading this novel and am having a hard time trying to think about the impact of this book. Owens, a zoologist by trade, weaves together a strong narrative of a lonesome girl on the edge of civilization with the behavior of animals in the wild. The connections are undeniable and as the story unfolds, we see more of how human behavior is similar to the animal kingdom and that at our very core, we are more animal than we think we are.This book teaches us that saving our environment, especially our wetlands, is vital to the future of our planet. Respect for other species, as well as other human beings, is being torn apart in today's world and we need to re-connect with nature and each other.This story shows how far we have come in terms of civil rights since the sixties but also how we have, by our mere growth in population, pushed wildlife back.This book also teaches how men and women, black and white, people and animals, need to respect each other.I found this line to be the most important in the book: "...his dad's definition of a man: one who can cry freely, feel poetry and opera in his heart, and do whatever it takes to defend a woman." The impact of this statement reverberates throughout the novel.There is a surprise ending which shocked me and I couldn't put the last quarter of the book down.There are some discrepancies, particularly that the cover of the book, of a girl paddling a canoe, does not match the real character of Kya, who drives a motorboat. For the paperback edition, it is my hope that the cover will reflect Kya's little motorboat.The themes are too numerous to mention as are the metaphors and similes. Owens is a masterful writer.	
R. Simon	1.0 out of 5 stars	May 6, 2019	Hardcover	SLUDGE	To echo fellow one-star reviewers, I found reading this “acclaimed” book painful going..like trudging through swamp or sludge.  Sloppy plot, not believable and yet not magical enough to resemble a fairytale.  Unbelievable characters speaking in the most  annoying dialect.  Mark Twain could get away with it but here it just doesn’t,t work.  I have often wondered what editors do these days.  Maybe too busy keeping  their eyes on the $$$$ to pay attention to what passes for literature?	4 people found this helpful
S M Boren	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 23, 2018	Hardcover	Where The Crawdads Sing	I purchased this book from Amazon to read with Hello Sunshine Bookclub. All opinions are my own. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Where The Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens. I would have never chosen this book to read for myself but I am so glad to be part of a Bookclub that did! This was a beautifully written book that will put you right in the marsh from the moment you pick it up. Kya was a girl left alone to defy all the odds of nature as a child and did so with minimal people and help and absolutely no adult supervision. While learning the laws of nature Kya struggles with loneliness but as she grows she learns more and more that much like nature the marsh has laws of it's own. Just as nature lives by its own rules so does the marsh. And sometimes just as in nature, the Marsh deals it's own justice to those who need it most. Kya soon finds herself in front of a jury facing a murder charge. But the marsh has no dealings with the law and tangled inside will hold many secrets the rest of the world refuses to see. Especially way out yonder where the crawdads sing.	One person found this helpful
Loni Gee	1.0 out of 5 stars	September 30, 2019	Kindle Edition	Spoiler Alert	Most of the book was quite unbelievable in the first place, but it is after all, fiction.  So, I guess unbelievable is par for the course.  However, Owens wasn't writing a wild fantasy, so I think it was meant to BE believable.  Kya is not believable.  Her survival skills and reading ability and book selling were too farfetched for me.But, the ending was too disappointing.  It's a book about revenge, and I was sorrowful about that.	2 people found this helpful
JusticeReads	5.0 out of 5 stars	May 6, 2019	Hardcover	The Most Touching Novel I've Ever Read!	I haven’t read many coming of age novels, but Where the Crawdads Sing was the pick for our book club for May and I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  Your heart goes out to the main character Kya right from the beginning.  Her family in disarray, her living conditions also completely pitiful but this story doesn’t focus on that.  Rather it talks about resilience.  The need to keep going to live, to thrive.  A young girl growing into adult hood and not by the help of her mother or sisters or aunts, but by nature.  You find everything from gulls to lightening bugs, fishing and digging for mussels.  The reader truly feels enveloped by the marsh and its inhabitants throughout this story.Kya goes on one emotional ride after the other and you can’t help but stay with her through her journeys of isolation.  How can one young person be so isolated but still have so much love in their heart?  We meet Tate early on and though we initially love him, he all people, makes his own mistakes.  I found it hard to forgive him but in the end found no other alternative.  Chase Andrews was the other guy we meet in this story, and I feel that we all have met a real life Chase at one time or another.  I absolutely hated him from the beginning to the end but loved that he was a character in this story because it needed him.  Our lives need a Chase Andrews so we can learn from them.  Most of us don’t find a perfect romance in the first love of our lives and instead we must be dealt a broken heart and learn how to put the pieces back together again and do our best to move on.So many other side characters in this novel, made this story so heartwarming and gut-wrenching all at the same time. Jumpin’ and Mabel are protectors I think we all wish we could have had and I don’t think I realized just how big Jumpin’s impact on Kya was until later in the story.  With touches on abandonment, isolation, survival, science, and love, Where the Crawdads Sing touched my heart in many different ways, with Kya taking a little piece of my heart along the way.	
SLCgirl	5.0 out of 5 stars	June 14, 2019	Kindle Edition	Gripping Story Line Against a Lush, Natural Setting	The book is beautifully written as Owens has a talent to turn a captivating phrase that can at once provoke a reflective pause, a smile and, yes ... a tear.  Don’t miss Owens’ fascinating bio on her web site:  “Her mother encouraged Delia to explore far into the oak forests where they lived in Georgia, saying “Go way out yonder where the crawdads sing.” Her mother taught her how to hike without stepping on rattle snakes, and most important not to be afraid of critters of any kind. Delia went on to spend most of her life in or near true wilderness, and since childhood has thought of Nature as a true companion. One of her best friends.”  Can’t wait to read future novels by this most interesting writer!	One person found this helpful
Dtam	5.0 out of 5 stars	July 18, 2019	Hardcover	Do yourself a favor and read this!	Where do I begin with this book? I did not want the story to end. This novel was enjoyable from the first sentence until the very last. First, it was very beautifully written; it provided such a clear depiction of the coast that I could smell the salt. The story made my heart hurt for Kya as well as be impressed and inspired by her all-in-one. I barely even cared about the murder storyline, I just wanted to follow Kya as she searched for shells and made her way through life. For those who complained this story isn't 'realistic' enough because how could a small child raise herself in a swamp and not get tetanus from stepping on a nail, you are sorely missing the deeper points of this novel, and perhaps the points of fiction in general. (I mean, I hate to break it to you - but Harry Potter wasn't a real life wizard, either!). I honestly feel a sense of grief knowing I have finished this book, that is how much I enjoyed it. It was an easy, summer read that I would recommend to nature lovers who enjoy a good story everywhere!I will say the one negative thing is the author's attempt at the character's accents. I get it was supposed to be a deep southern accent, but it was very distracting and half the time I wasn't sure what they were actually saying, since the words were completely nonsensical. I think this could have been achieved with less of a drastic attempt at changing the language.	
BaumanBookReviews	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 29, 2019	Hardcover	Incredible Read!	First things first, I love being in nature. It’s still winter here in the Midwest. Even though we are starting to get hints of spring, it’s not in full bloom. Being able to escape into the forest and the marsh through this book was so awesome. Delia Owens’s descriptions really bring the scene to life. I’ve read a few opinions on the book saying that it was too descriptive, but it was perfect for me.All of the characters had really interesting developments. I felt like every character had their stories wrapped up in a fitting fashion. One of them, we never really find out what happens – but, again, it’s fitting. Kya is the main character, and I don’t think you could even ask for more character development. It seems like we got just enough of her life story for it to be complete and wrapped up. That is SO satisfying to me because you don’t always get that.I just absolutely loved this book. A mixture of a coming of age story as well as a murder mystery and a love note to nature. It’s just beautifully written. The story is told so well. I didn’t want it to end. I would recommend it to anyone who loves nature.This book has one of the greatest last chapters I’ve ever read in a novel. It ties things up without blatantly just laying out answers to your questions. It’s so beautifully written and wraps up years of Kya’s life swiftly but respectfully.5/5 StarsMemorable Quotes: “Sometimes she heard night-sounds she didn’t know or jumped from lightning too close, but whenever she stumbled, it was the land that caught her. Until at last, at some unclaimed moment, the heart-pain seeped away like water into sand. Still there, but deep. Kya laid her head upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.”“Crows can’t keep secrets any better than mud; once they see something curious in the forest they have to tell everybody.”“Autumn was coming; the evergreens might not have noticed, but the sycamores did. They flashed thousands of golden leaves across slate-gray skies.”“Evil was not in play, just life pulsing on, even at the expense of some of the players. Biology sees right and wrong as the same color in different light.”	
Amy	4.0 out of 5 stars	June 2, 2019	Hardcover	A book that almost met the hype!	One of the hyped up books of Instagram! I am always afraid to read books that are full of such hype--they are always hit or miss with me. Where the Crawdads Sing has nearly five stars on Goodreads, which is outstanding. I loved this book, but I had a few issues with it that held back one star.Poor Kya had an extremely hard childhood...abandoned by her family, made fun of at school the one time she went, she is a true daughter of the marsh. Hence the name, "Marsh Girl". Everyone makes fun of her, fears her, thinks she is "different" than them, which scares them.With the help of a few compassionate people, and her eagerness to learn and live, Kya makes a life for herself. However, one of the town favorites, Chase Andrews, is found dead, and Kya is the immediate favorite suspect. She is different from the other town folk--she has never fit in or tried to fit in, which gives her a "mark" none of the other townspeople have. So, with no real evidence, the town (minus a few people) is determined to blame Kya for the untimely death of Chase. What happens will definitely shock you!I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading a book about a strong female heroine who has gone against all odds to become successful, and define success for herself. She lives the life she wants to live, instead of conforming to the norms of society, and that is a truly beautiful thing. The only thing I didn't like was the ending--I think you will see what I mean. I could have used more explanation, more discussion about it.	
The Book Wheel	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 19, 2019	Kindle Edition	Where the Crawdads Sing and the Resiliency of the Human Spirit	Kya Clark had every reason to believe the world was set against her. Left to fend for herself at the age of ten and forced to raise herself in a small, rundown shack in the marshes of coastal North Carolina, Kya lived life in the shadows. Despite her deep longing to step into the light, past experiences taught her that living on the fringe was safer. Yet, the basic human desire to connect with others had a strong pull, leading her down a path that precariously straddled the line between being seen and remaining invisible.Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is, quite simply, a stunning novel. It is an incredible story of loss, loneliness, and the indomitable human spirit. Cast out by the community for her poverty and feared by children for being different, she ensconces herself in nature: the land, the water, and especially, the birds. With her identity so deeply tied to the land and sea, her two most reliable friends, it is impossible to tell where she begins and nature ends.Yet despite the cruelties fate handed to her, there are some who see her and gift her with kindness. It’s impossible, after all, to survive completely alone, particularly at such a young age. Two young men, in particular, bestow her with the attention she craved all her life. But as with all matters of the heart, things are not quite what they seem, and Kya learns firsthand that for each action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Still, it was the small kindnesses of strangers that brought tears to my eyes, but it was the equally small cruelties that had me holding my breath, hoping for a miraculous change in circumstances.Where the Crawdads Sing is notable for its unforgettable protagonist who proves that the human spirit can withstand nearly any obstacle, not to mention its lyrical beauty. But what is truly outstanding is how Owens manages to get to the core of humanity: the need to be seen and the need to connect (Sugar Run is another book that does this well).With all that said, I would be doing the author and the book a disservice if I didn’t also take care to discuss the richness of the setting, which feels both real and imagined in its magic. This is a book that blasts the senses: I could smell the sea, feel the crunch of the leaves under my feet, and hear the vibrations of boats coming into the lagoon. It bears repeating that it’s impossible to see where Kya begins and nature ends, for they are so intertwined that one cannot exist without the other and is evident by the way the author seamlessly blends them together and the story soars as a result.The result is a stunning novel of utter beauty in every way possible: its damaged and lovable protagonist, its descriptive scenery, and the shocking way the story unfolds. It’s easy to see why this one rocketed to the top of the charts and I am already eagerly awaiting her next book.	
Amazon Customer	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 20, 2019	Kindle Edition	Read this book!	For those who appreciate the beauty and preservation of the earth, this book will suck you in and never let you go. Exceptional prose spotted with poetry, unique characters and beautiful landscapes, all woven together within the complex concepts of loneliness, desire and the deep human need for belonging. While the relationships were not always fully believable for me at their surface, I saw the depth they brought to Kya’s story, as well as a value in them insofar as they demonstrated the ways one can be persuaded to sacrifice pieces of themselves and their world in exchange for a chance of belonging and feeling loved. The deep ache of human connection and the cost on both sides rings out through every page of this exquisitely written novel. Typically, I see writers who excel at prose, but fall short on plot lines, or those with stellar stories, but only so-so written finesse. Delia Owens brings both, and thensome.I think one might argue that the natural descriptions throughout the book, though brilliantly vivid and atmospheric, felt lengthy and overwhelming at times, leaving the reader lost, dancing through the marsh, rather than attending the plot itself — but to me that was a distinct and brilliant beauty Owens offered with this book. As a reader, you got lost in Kya’s mind, in her world, her marsh home and her distinct and utter solitude. You could notice things slowly and deliberately as she did, truly drinking in the Marsh in a way that others would not notice. You came to understand - through the gulls, the hawks, the mud, the fireflies - the depth of her mind and what had shaped it, allowing you to be built into her world from the inside out. While far from an edge-of-your-seat thriller, I found this approach to be deeply soothing and engaging, in a way that touched me deep in my core.	2 people found this helpful
alison	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 6, 2019	Kindle Edition	best book in a long time	Other reviewers give enough information about this book for you to decide whether or not to read it. Here is my experience: pure delight from the first sentence to the last, with many sentences and paragraphs worthy of re-reading. I didn't want it to end. But when I finished the book, I sat there for about ten minutes, then turned to the first page to re-read just a bit--and several hours later, finished the second time through. The first time there is that element of "what happened, whodunit?" and the second time there's the pleasure of seeing how the author develops the characters and of re-reading about that splendid part of the world. I bought it for my sister and my best friend, and they both wrote to thank me for it after they finished it--best book they'd read in a long time too.	One person found this helpful
E. M. Moore	3.0 out of 5 stars	October 22, 2018	Kindle Edition	Great story, weak ending!	So much to love about this book, particularly Kya, the lonely lover of her natural world, abandoned as a small child by her biological family. But the ending felt rushed and contrived - like the author wasn't quite confident in her format and needed to complete with a bang of courtroom drama.	4 people found this helpful
DeeDee	5.0 out of 5 stars	April 6, 2019	Kindle Edition	Wonderful!  Best Read in a long time!	Not one to read something because it is on best seller list I had read something about this book in a magazine and thought it might be good and interesting! I had no idea of the ride I was fixing to take! It was an emotional roller coaster in places and then a soaring ride in other places. The beauty displayed in every word was so amazing! The nature story was so visional you could see your self in the places even the smells! The human side of this story was gut wrenching at times you kept asking yourself why and how could this happen to someone and that person come out on the other side.  Taking place in a time where people were in a state of live and let live "I do not want to involved " made this story real. It is full of the social injustices that we hear about now  every single day! But this amazing story of human nature and surviving was so wonderful it made you leap for joy! The ending is totally the absolute best but you can not share with any one who has not read it because you do not want to take that feeling away! Sharing this book with someone who has read it is great because they too understand! No wonder it has been a book club book to so many. I hated for it to end! I sit alone just pondering all that I had read! So many things to think about! I read this on my kindle but I am going to buy the book because there are places I want to read again!  Five stars is not enough!! Read this book if you love amazing stories that can captive your heart!	
Lucky in KC	5.0 out of 5 stars	July 9, 2019	Kindle Edition	Do NOT read the end of the book before you start or finish it...seriously.	Holy Wow...I LOVED (and still love) this novel...so much so that I'm not sure I can do it justice.The writing was almost lyrical...it just flowed. Does that make sense?  Even though I was reading it, at times it seemed as if I were right there. No, not as a character but as an observer.  This sounds weird but there were times I swear my breathing slowed down. Especially when the characters were in the marsh. Ms. Owens described people, places and things with astonishing reverence.  Plain and simple...?? I didn't want it to end. I've talked to other people who have read it and we all agree that when we finished reading it, we waited almost a week before starting on another novel. Everything about it stays with you for awhile.I'm not sure I'd want to see it were it made into a movie.  I think the nuances and finessing would be lost on film.As for those who gave this book angry one star reviews, I'm not sure what they missed.The only thing I can think of is that they forgot it was fiction.I don't want to give anything away so I'm going to keep this short.  But...if you take this book to the beach or the pool, slather on the sunscreen b/c you won't want to put the book down to get into the water or shade.	
book lover	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 3, 2019	Hardcover	WOW. Don't miss this one!	WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING  by Delia OwensWOW! Just WOW! This is a great book.  Murder, abandoned child, growing up alone, nature, young love, sex, ecology, love, poetry, betrayal, education, redemption, forgiveness, treachery -- it is all here. Well written with strong characters and even stronger biology, Owens debut novel is clearly a winner.The North Carolina coastal region and the animals, birds, flowers, grasses, etc. are as much a character as the human in this book. Kya, Chase, Jumpin’, Mabel and Tate are the main humans in this beautiful elegy to nature and the human spirit.Saying too much more will spoil the “mystery” in the book, so just know that is a book that should not be missed.  Book groups will find much to discuss and ponder. Biologists and sportsmen/women will appreciate the accuracy of the science.5 of 5 stars	One person found this helpful
Phost	5.0 out of 5 stars	March 6, 2019	Hardcover	Holy mackerel...	My 94 year old grandfather suggested I read this, so of course I purchased it immediately. He told me, "lock yourself in a room for the last 30 pages, so no one can disturb you." My mom got the same suggestion from him and blazed through it, and said the same thing about the last 30 pages and was entirely enthralled when we were on a family vacation. I'm more than halfway through and I have to stop myself from starting a new chapter or I would actually never stop and never sleep.The author has a way of describing people and places to make you feel as though you are breathing the same air Kya is breathing. The connection to nature one feels when reading this incredible piece of literature is like no reading experience ever before. This is the best book I have read in years, probably ever. Owens touches on racial tension in the south, societal norms and cruelty to the 'other' and explicates scenarios of love and coming of age is beautiful prose. The reader is kept on their toes, at all times, and just when you think you understand something, another detail arises causing you to question.A true must read!!	One person found this helpful
Pamela	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 28, 2019	Kindle Edition	A fascinating book!	How could this young child be so forgotten?  A mother walks away without looking back. Her older siblings leave. A loving brother ends up leaving her!  Eventually, so does the drunken father.  She is raised by the marsh she lives in.  There was a lot about this book that was "hard to believe" for sure, but what a story!  As a teacher of reading, I was fascinated about Kya's ability to learn to read so well, but with determination and grit, it can be done!  I never liked Chase as a character, but that's because I knew so much more than Kya did about him.  Her naivety about love and romance and just people in general allowed her to be sucked into the relationship with Chase. Oh, and let's mention Tate--the real love of her life, right?  Another person who left her!  Kya should have hated life, but she never did.  That is what nature taught her.  Love the beauty in all things, but only trust those who prove their loyalty to you.This was a fascinating read.  I loved the ending and wasn't really surprised except by the poet's identity!  Very clever!  I highly recommend this book.  I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.	
Lynne	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 4, 2019	Kindle Edition	A Phenomenal Story	So good, So good, So good!!!This story was so well written! What amazing character development! This book was EVERYTHING!!!Kya grows up in North Carolina, her entire family ends up leaving her to raise herself in the marsh. Isolated from the outside world besides a few acquaintances, Kya is labeled the "marsh girl." Townspeople judging her, bullying her, and staying as far away as possible from her.Chase Anderson, the former star high school quarterback, is murdered, pushed from the top of a water tower. No fingerprints, no footprints, no physical evidence. A shell necklace made for him by Kya years before when they were involved is taken from Chase's neck following his death. This seems to be enough evidence for the sheriff to bring in Kya for questioning.Where the Crawdads Sing would make an amazing film. This was such a page turner, keeping me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Is Kya guilty of murder or is she not? Exciting until the last page!!! Loved everything about this story!!!	
meme	5.0 out of 5 stars	May 11, 2019	Kindle Edition	A spellbinding story	A story about a child who was abandoned by every member of her family, ostracized by her community, failed by the community social services and school system. Raised by herself and the wild creatures of the marsh she was only able to attend school for one day. With the aid of a friend who she met in the marsh she learned to read, paint and be a scientist of the marsh. She was betrayed by her first love when he went away to college. The second relationship was about conquest by the male. He was a male predator who threaten her more than her drunk  father ever had. He was murdered and she was charged with his murder even though she was out of town at a business meeting. She was ruled not guilty by a jury. She returned to her home in the marsh and lived with her first love until she died at work in the marsh. After her funeral her mate found evidence that she had indeed killed the male predator who caused her so much anguish. He destroyed all of her evidence. She was the author of many books and scientific data. She left her slice of the marsh in a trust so it would remain a marsh. A life that was self taught and well lived. A man who loved her.	
PattiL	5.0 out of 5 stars	February 26, 2019	Kindle Edition	BEST book I've read in a very long time!!!	I loved this book from the very start.  Her character descriptions put you right there.  Those little feelings in the heart were right there.  The prejudices and hurting was right there.  I immediately did a search for other books by her, but I believe this is her only novel, so far.  She and her husband have written 3 other books, which I will be looking into, I believe they're documentary.  But if she's writing those, they're going to be great as well, I'm sure.  You can't go wrong reading this book.  It would be ok for young people too, it explains a lot about the natural Marsh life that lives in them.  Also a good lesson about not being prejudiced about people you don't know.  Highly recommend it.	One person found this helpful
Lee J	4.0 out of 5 stars	February 18, 2019	Kindle Edition	A beautifully told story	This is a spectacular book. It is one of the few that I couldn’t put down until I had turned the last digital page. It was beautifully written and totally engrossing. I loved that it was a mystery as well as being chock full of animal and bird lore and description of coastal life. The characters were vivid and memorable. There was only one annoying thing for me. In this lovely, sad story, filled with descriptive language, of a child left to care for herself, the author disappointed me, an English teacher and lexophile, by using the  word gift as a verb, not once but several times. The last time I looked, gift was a noun. The word give as a verb has served us well for a long, long time, and like so many other words that some writers and speakers of the English language have used incorrectly, “gifting” has insidiously crept into vocabularies and replaced “giving.” Just one more thing along with apostrophes incorrectly used in plurals that spoils my love of reading. “Gifting” may have a place on Facebook and may not bother those who have no love of language, but I took away a star for it. Authors are my heroes, and this author’s white hat slipped a little in this beautiful story of courage, determination and everyday scientific beauty.

Amazon Customer	5.0 out of 5 stars	April 6, 2019	Kindle Edition	Hauntingly beautiful	Beautifully written around a North Carolina coastal marsh,  I, too, found it  unrealistic that a 6 year old girl managed to raise herself yet I kept in mind that it was set back in the 1950s-1960s -- a different era, an era in which I grew up.  And I couldn't believe ALL family members abandoned this little girl, yet once I suspended my disbelief, I was drawn in by the beautiful language and the setting of the novel.Kya was born an observer -- she talks about watching her mother fix meals and paint.  Her brother Jodie talked about the secrets of the marsh and she observed how he handled a boat.  Some people just watch and some people observe -- Kya absorbed what she observed and that was her salvation.  And her ability to observe then transfer her observations to paper is what enabled her to earn a living once in her 20s. And there were people who did help Kya -- Jumpin, Jumpin's wife Mabel, the checkout lady at the Piggly Wiggly, and Tate.  They helped as much as she would let them help.A mystery stalks the reader throughout the story, and, wow, I did not see that ending coming.Delia Owens' plot and her beautiful use of language drew me in and kept me turning the pages until the end and this morning, I'm still in the marsh.  That's the best compliment I can give a book -- that in my mind, I'm still in that book's setting and thinking about the characters.	
L. Gompf	3.0 out of 5 stars	November 25, 2019	Kindle Edition	Couldn't escape into the book because of so many hurt-my-brain alternative facts.	It was a good story. It could have been a 4-star story if there had been some research and editing. So much of the details of the non-biological bits were so wrong. A novel should be something one can lose oneself in. I kept being jarred back to normal life by the sheer impossibility of some of the things. The bit about Asheville being the nearest big city drove me insane, and then to add insult to injury, Greenville is only 1 1/2 hours from the coast?!  Apparently in humid marshes mold doesn't destroy cardboard or anything else on paper. Storms off the NC coast rarely last more than a few hours and there were no strong winds or flooding or anything else to bother the structure of huts. If I didn't have it on my Kindle I would have thrown the book across the room more than a few times. Whatever happened to editors who, well, make sure the writers aren't making up stuff they aren't supposed to be making up? It could have been a good book, but it wasn't. Ms. Owens, next time pick a publisher that knows how to help get the facts straight.	
mhs26	2.0 out of 5 stars	September 18, 2019	Kindle Edition	Disappointing	I thought I was going to like this book and I really tried. I enjoyed the first half despite the ridiculous scenario of a girl raising herself in a swamp, but it quickly devolved for me as there was more and more emphasis placed on the murder subplot. The plot was obvious from the beginning (including the ending), but I could have enjoyed the journey despite that if it hadn't meandered so much in the middle.I really didn't care about "the victim" so every part where the cops are investigating the murder are of little interest to me. The courtroom scenes were downright painful. Honestly, it felt like I was reading a different book entirely.What bothered me the most though was that Kya started out as such a unique character with a weird background yet was somehow simultaneously a cliche. She's a strong, self-sufficient tomboy which in it of itself is a bit of a cliche, but then she's also a secret beauty who everyone finds attractive and she doesn't even realize it. Yes, the girl starving in the swamp, crawling around in mud, and doesn't bathe is a super hottie - of course. Additionally she's incredibly intelligent and required very little help to become a scholar on her own. I don't have a huge problem with that part, but I'm kind of sick of the trope where every young, female protagonist has to be a girl who doesn't recognize her beauty, needs a cute boy to tell her she's hot, but it doesn't matter because she's super smart too.Additionally, her romance with Tate was a snooze for me. He was too much of a good guy stereotype. This is another trope in romance novels where the male love interest is such a gentleman that he loves the girl immediately and always (even if they have their issues/breakups), he is super concerned with her purity (no sex for you young lady until I tell you it's okay), and he seems to act more fatherly/protective of her than he does as a lover. I find this trope to be troubling because it reinforces this idea that girls can't have their own sexual agency unless a man gives them permission. Sure Kya ends up doing her own thing out of desperation regardless of Tate, but their romance felt cliched and boring instead of sweet as I assume it was supposed to be. Perhaps this is just a personal preference on my part though.I also disliked the phonetic spellings in dialogue. I get that the writer is trying to give us a sense of the dialect in the region/time period, but there was too much of it.The third person perspective also didn't work for me largely because it's constantly jumping around. At any given time you might be slipping in and out of multiple different character's heads within the same section. It was a bit confusing at times and made me feel disconnected from any single character. I don't mind perspective changing, but this book did it in such an unorganized fashion and spread to so many different characters that it detached me from all of them.All that being said, there are parts of this book that are well written with beautiful prose. There's something intriguing about the protagonist and her life, but I just didn't care about the overall plot at all. I would have been happier reading a story about Kya, Jumpin', and Mabel and left it at that.	
KayTee	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 22, 2019	Kindle Edition	Sorry when book ended	This was not a complicated read, but it was - for lack of a better description-very satisfying. I came to care for the characters, dislike some as well. Was moved to tears several times, which was evidence to me of the power of the author’s ability to invest the reader in her tale. I feel as if I know the marsh despite never having been there. Possibly the only weak link was that I was not surprised by the ending - indeed expected it. But maybe this was also intended by the author.I was sorry when it ended.	2 people found this helpful

My heart was in no way prepared for the emotions Delia Owens made me feel. Every page is absolutely engrossing and beautifully written. The heart-wrenching loneliness and vulnerability put on display only makes the connections forged feel so much deeper. I genuinely can't a remember a time when I have felt this strongly about any book. If you don't read this book in your lifetime, you are doing yourself a disservice.	2 people found this helpful
AG	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 6, 2019	Hardcover	Amazing Book. Beautifully written. Great story.	Before reading this book, I did some research about the author and listened to a few of her interviews. As a young girl,  I was always fascinated by Lions and Elephants, so I was immediately immersed by the author’s life in Africa and the isolation she experienced living in a wilderness with these animals. This book as she described it, is about human nature in its core with isolation. The writing is beautiful and poetic. The character, Kya Clark is the epitome of strength and how one survives abandonment and continuous disappointments. Yet, finds love and learns to trust again. She will touch different emotions in every readers,  and will take them into an adventurous journey filled with sadness,  but  ultimately contentment at its core. Highly, highly recommend this book.

Jan D.	2.0 out of 5 stars	March 21, 2019	Kindle Edition	What does if take to write  bestseller.	The author created a unique and memorable character with the marsh girl and her lifelong friend Tate, what went wrong is the use of the flavor of the day editing style of contemporary films. Backward, jump forward and backward again and again.Instead of sticking with her original characters, she wanted and failed miserably more tension by creating a very unbalanced back story of a generic sheriff and his sidekick that ultimately end up in a court case not unlike in on  of the most famous American novels.She should have stuck with her characters and she would have written a remarkable original voice story.Right now, trying to please to many masters, it is just an average coming of age story.

TAKelley	5.0 out of 5 stars	May 5, 2019	Kindle Edition	Oh Little Marsh Girl	When I see this book in Amazons top 100 I was not sure about reading it. But when I seen over 10,000 reviews and most positive I figured it was worth a read. I was not disappointed in short this was and outstanding read.The story is set in the marshlands of North Carolina and is focused on the main character Kya. At the start of the story it is almost shocking with the fact of the mother walking away and in time so does the rest of the family one by one including the father who is a real piece of work. But Kya from an early age finds away to survive and deal with the isolation and the way that the towns people look down on anyone that lives in the marshlands. As Kya grows she ends up with in interesting places but will they stick around. The ultimate test is when the once upon a time star quarterback of the local high school is found dead and Kya becomes a suspect. I really like a lot of the descriptions of how she became at one with nature, really out of necessity . I will tell there is a part towards the end of the book concerning Kya that really made me mad. Definitely give this book a read it is as smooth as a long summer day. I could see were this might be made into a movie at some point.	
Karen C. Smith	3.0 out of 5 stars	October 27, 2018	Kindle Edition	A Naturalist’s Delight	The is a charming novel, with beautifully rendered descriptions of nature in the swamps and wetlands.  The story of Kya requires you to suspend disbelief because it never quite fleshes out her story of survival when abandoned at age six.  I kept wondering how she survived life on the far margins of society.  This is really the only “catch” in an orherwise delightful novel.  The story of Kya is one of resilience in spite of insurmountable odds.	3 people found this helpful
SueBell	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 20, 2019	Hardcover	A great book to read!!!	This book makes you want to take a trip to the marshes of Carolina to breath the air, hear the wind and the insects. The book becomes a live as you read the descriptions are so clear that you can take a vacation in your mind and experience what Kya experienced. Her art and knowledge shown through her books that taught people about the marsh. The town did Kya wrong they should have come to her aide when they knew her circumstances but they failed her. It reminds me of the description in the book about the female prey-mantis calling a mate while they are mating the female eats the male. In the end this rang true for Kya and she did as what nature wanted her to do.I found myself on a roller coaster ride that had me so sad at times that tears rolled down my cheeks and other times I was preying for Kya to survive. Abandonment is a serious issue it does so much harm to children and it broke my heart what happened to her. Kya also is someone who is a survivor she is full of strength. Her ability to overcome her circumstance at ever turn is remarkable her resilience level is through the roof.Mrs. Owens thank you for reminding me that kindness can go a long way. That our humanity can be so disgusting to turn our back on someone who may need to hear a hello or a few dollars to buy some food. Their are many Kya's in the world and we as a people as part of nature need to remember that we all need each other in some form or fashion. Each of us has are own brilliance within us and sometimes we need a little helping hand to shine brightly like a firefly. I want so badly now to go to hear the crawdads sing I am sure it is the most peaceful music I will ever hear.	
Darlene	5.0 out of 5 stars	June 21, 2019	Kindle Edition	Beautifully written, heartfelt story of survival	Where The Crawdads Sing deals with isolation and Kya's challenges of surviving on her own for nearly 20 years in the swampland marshes of North Carolina.  The author's brilliant, descriptive writing ability immediately captivated me with her use of figurative language.  Her metaphors, similes and personification combined to create a very poetic quality to her ongoing narrative, further enhanced by her occasional inclusion of poetry.  I loved the author's several references to the title of her book, and I was especially impressed with the well-developed resolution to her novel.  Much can be learned from reading this book, as it has a depth to it that it's critics seem unable to fathom.  Although the storyline seems a bit implausible at times, it provides insights into the varying natures of men and women, their biases and prejudices, relevant to the times in which we now live.  I look forward to reading Delia Owens' next novel.

Charlotte L.	3.0 out of 5 stars	August 30, 2019	Kindle Edition	Has the author ever been to NC?	I liked the writing but I would say the author set her story in a place she has never visited or spent very little time. I don’t understand her use of references to Asheville multiple times in the story. She has no idea how far away that is from the coast. The county attorney bought his ties there in a Sears? Well, that would be a six and a half hour trip in the modern age of interstates. Back after WW2 the distance on two lane country highways would probably more like ten hours. Her lack of familiarity with the state makes it a curious choice for her story. Her expertise on marsh and swamp is laudable.	One person found this helpful
TribalTech	3.0 out of 5 stars	November 19, 2019	Hardcover	Ugh! Reese Please!!	The fact that it had 25000 reviews should have prompted me to do some research on how this book got so popular. Not until I'd read 80% of it did I realize/ find out that Reese W. had recommended this book. Ugh! Anyway so my issue with this book is that it is so so shamelessly unrealistic that it makes my skull hurt. So much nonsense about how this marsh girl survives on her own and becomes literate pretty much on her own, becomes the best painter and wetlands researcher on her own while living in a shack with no formal education whatsoever and goes onto become a prolific scientific author...the list of unrealistic nonsense goes on and on. The only reason i give it 3 stars is that the story line is decent and the ending is riveting. But when I think about how unrealistic everything was to get to that point it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. There are way better books. Waste your time with this at your own peril.	
GEMSCAT	4.0 out of 5 stars	September 27, 2019	Hardcover	Unique Compelling Story of Kya & the NC Marsh!	Really enjoyed this Unique Compelling novel centered around the character of Kya, known as the “Marsh Girl” who grew up from a young age by herself in a Shack in the marsh in Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the coast of North Carolina.  The story begins in 1952 through 1970, although the ending summarizes Kya’s later years & completes Kya’s story.It’s interesting to read about life in the Marsh with the many detailed descriptions of the marsh’s inhabitants (birds, insects, shells, lagoons, etc) woven throughout the novel.  It’s also interesting to read about the people of Barkley Cove back in the 50’s, 60’s & 70’s, what times were like back then & those that helped Kya, her challenges & struggles & her achievements.The very end of the book in “The Firefly” chapter had a surprise ending, which I didn’t like, although it’s understandable from the perspective of the other elements in the book.I applaud Delia Owens first novel,	
C. Hope Clark	5.0 out of 5 stars	May 23, 2019	Hardcover	A Book to Sink Into - Sensory Beauty	It has been several years since a book touched me so much. I'm a nature lover, an agriculture graduate, someone who thinks that the worst part of dying is leaving and not being able to smell rain or touch the bark of a tree. . . leaving nature behind. But this book is rich on so many other levels, too. First, the writing is superb, lyrical, touching.  I would have paid good money to see a heart-felt conversation between Delia Owens and Pat Conroy, because they both could take the world and paint it beautifully, similarly. Secondly, Ms. Owens makes us see ourselves on a deeper level. We have felt all of these Kya emotions, who is such a simple, beautiful soul, yet have been too afraid to NOT be a part of a much nastier society for fear of what others would think. We fear reprisal for being unique. In the end the reader almost wishes they had the courage to have lived their life as a Kya, but in reality, at least had the chance to pretend so through the eyes of the Marsh Girl. This is a story that will stay with me a long, long time. Few stories I've read have drawn a tear like this one.	
Erika	5.0 out of 5 stars	May 24, 2019	Kindle Edition	Highly entertaining story	This book was extremely well written and told a story about people who are very rarely represented in books. Kaia has grown up on a marsh her whole life, but at age six she is abandoned and essentially left to raise herself. She learns to rely on nature and a few good hearted people to survive and make her way.When a popular young man, Chase Andrews, takes interest in Kaia and is later found dead, Kaia becomes a suspect in his untimely and suspicious death. This story follows Kaia before the murder of Chase Andrews and after. It is a stunning portrayal of a young women who is forced to pave her own way; and somehow she manages to do so.Delia Owens is an incredible writer and I loved the poetic writing style of this novel. I could very clearly picture the characters and the story in my mind and felt as if I knew them and envisioned them just how Ms. Owens wanted them to be. The book represents the time period wonderfully, even in the most subtle ways. I would highly recommend this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I predict it will become an American classic.	
Meredith Whisler	2.0 out of 5 stars	May 30, 2019	Kindle Edition	Let down	This story, while interesting at the beginning, was ultimately a disappointment. I also feel that some of my frustration is not just from  the book, but from the rave reviews it has received. The offensively inaccurate accents, as others have mentioned before, made me cringe. Our award winning, book writing, brilliant heroine just happens to be so stunningly beautiful that she wins the eye of two most sought after men in the town (because she’s so exotic and wild!) after having had to raise herself on her own with out access to running water or a toothbrush. Please. Setting realistic expectations aside, the plot is decent, but the characters lack any depth. Any time I thought I was about to form my own opinion about a statement, I was the told what to think about it. All in a all, an okay plot and a decent page turner for a 13 year old.	2 people found this helpful
VCCats	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 12, 2019	Hardcover	A different, engaging story.	The writer wrote in such a poetic way; it took me back to the books my parents used to read to me when I was younger.  While I was reading Where the Crawdads Sing, it was so easy to be there with Kya, it's an experience that's hard to explain, but readers get what I mean. Delia Owens painted a clear and artistic story filled with emotion, heartache, and all the things that come along with life. I was walking with Kya while she searched for rare seashells, I was there when she drove over to Jumpin, and I was there when she met Tate.Until this book, I had been going through a reading slump. Hadn't picked up a new book on months, and the last one I had read left me discouraged. I didn't even finish it, that's how disinterested I became. I'm not in the market anymore for a new series, and I haven't read a book with magic in it in ages. I knew that I needed something new, but I didn't know what.Now all I want to do is reread this one!My Mom had already reread it twice by the time I picked it up. She kept telling me to read it, and I kept putting it off. Crazy huh?Anyway, if you are looking for a different coming of age story I recommend Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens, I am so happy that this is a New York Times Best Seller, and that it's sold over a million copies. Delia deserves it for writing such a fantastic story. And it's her first book, too!	
Kindle Customer	5.0 out of 5 stars	October 12, 2018	Kindle Edition	ALONE AND FORGOTTEN	This is a sad soul searching  of a family living on the edge of humanity. Rejection because of where you lived..no heart only physical and mental abuse. Never having enough to eat, clothing yourself with whatever someone gave you. No shoes barefoot and no hope of anyone concerned about the welfare of a young seven year old girl child abandoned by her family and society. Prejudice and mean spirited humans who never had a kind word or a simple hug a pat on your back, no acknowledgement other making fun of you turning their backs to you, as if you never existed.So many families are facing abuse every twenty-four seven  no let up never knowing if you have food or whose going to knock on your door to serve eviction notice. The author speaks of croaker sacks, I remember my mother talking about how her sisters boiled those sacks to make them softer, then they bleached them. My Mom said that's what they made their dresses from. What Kya went through, I've witnessed and it's heartbreaking. There were tears reading about how sad and lonely her life had become. Finding solace and comfort with nature and her children. It's almost as if she became one with her surroundings. Everybody abandoned her, no hope but she had herself and Jumpin, Mabel and Tate. Her brother Jodie who found her and told her about their mother who was mentally beaten down by life that her husband who may seemed to blame the war for his alcoholism and his mean demeaning ways toward his family. Her father didn't want or let his children go to school said it was useless and wasteful. Maybe the father didn't want his children to  do better than him so ran them away with his abusive ways.I recommend everyone read about the lives of people who live on the margins of society, totally ignored, the church or government programs totally passing over them. Poverty is way of life nothing more or less...This is a heartbreaking realism of life put forth on paper.	
S. Warfield	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 16, 2019	Kindle Edition	I loved this exquisite book	What I love most about this book is the beautifulnature writing and the character development of main character, Kya Clark.  Rural 1950s North Carolina is the setting, among the marshes, lagoons and poverty, that Kya knows as the world around her.  Abandoned first by her mother, then her brothers, sisters and finally her father, Kya is left as a child alone to fend for herself in this world where she is referred to as "the Marsh girl" and shunned by other mothers because she is dirty.There are some beautifully written sentences and passages in this book as well as a mystery central to the story.  When Kya finds love, her life changes, but not her basic self and the way she lives.  The story plays out to a dramatic ending that fits so well within this beautiful book.	
ppsc	3.0 out of 5 stars	August 25, 2019	Kindle Edition	Fascinating but so unbelievable, it gives me mixed feelings	The book was generally well-written (as in, without grammatical mistakes), and it was a quick read which held my attention from beginning to end.  The characters were interesting and fairly well-developed.  In these respects I liked it, but the ending was quite predictable and contrived.  Also,the entire history of the main character was so unbelievable as to read more like fantasy or science- fiction than a mystery.  None of the events which occurred seemed believable to me, and in restrospect, I can only give the book 3 stars.  My initial feeling was that the book was very fascinating, but as it continued, the plot got more and more hard to believe.  Just sayin'	
BosMA	5.0 out of 5 stars	May 17, 2019	Kindle Edition	A delightful read	When Owens describes nature, her writing is lyrical. I so enjoyed reading the exquisite prose in Part I: The Marsh.  I also enjoyed reading about this young woman's strength and integrity in the face of abandonment and ridicule, not to mention her experiences growing up by a marsh and fending for herself from an early age. The heart of the novel is Kya's oneness with the environment--of her marsh-world and her ability to know and translate that world for others despite a lifetime of being scorned by the community. Owens does a first-rate job of drawing Kya in full. The reader feels like a townie who observes the young woman from among the reeds, silently encouraging her, observing generously, not judgmentally.	
Pegasus	5.0 out of 5 stars	November 4, 2019	Hardcover	A CHARMING AND SURPRISING TALE	It's too bad the publishers touted this as a murder mystery, which is a terribly limited view of the narrative. The story of a young woman who raises herself and becomes an unwilling authority on local flora and fauna, the central anguish she experiences is separation from the community. She has perhaps one real friend, maybe two, and is the object of derision and suspicion by the people who occupy the town that is peripheral to her life. She remains shrouded in mystery right to the end. I confess I listened to this as an audio book before buying a copy to read aloud to my husband. It is very much an aural story. I just loved it.	
Melissa Whipple	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 20, 2018	Kindle Edition	Marsh-Luscious Masterpiece of Plot and Prose.	Where the Crawdads Sing is a fantastic, marsh-lusicious story that explores violence, nature, biology, friendship, cruelty, family, loneliness, mystery, wet places, fear, small town villains and unlikely heroes. It weaves in human strength, resiliency,  persistence, resolution, justice, peace and secrets. . .with authenticity and beauty.  I was enthralled, appalled, and entertained.  I wept. I reflected. I judged and I forgave.  The prose is heaven for lovers of language, and the compelling plot, which alternates each chapter between past and present events, eventually merging them together, kept me guessing and hoping. It is a mesmerizing masterpiece.	One person found this helpful
Cheryl E. Hasebe	5.0 out of 5 stars	April 22, 2019	Kindle Edition	Exquisite, ethereal and unforgettable!!	If I had to use three words to describe this book, they would be exquisite, ethereal and unforgettable.  Be patient with the first 30 pages as the author describes the marsh.  The best is yet to come and this description is important because the marsh is such an important character.  The language the author uses is lush and almost poetic.  The characters come to life and one feels like they know them.  I was so bereft when I finished this book, that I immediately reread it and loved it just as much the second time.  Take your time and savor this book.  I have purchased three copies for three important women in my life, as well as the three books that the author wrote with her ex-husband.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEAUTIFUL BOOK!!	
Pamela I. Perkins	5.0 out of 5 stars	September 26, 2018	Kindle Edition	Wow! This book is a treasure!	It is difficult to imagine living alone for so much of one’s young life: the despair and longing for friendship. Kia managed through embracing and interacting with the lives in the marsh - birds and mammals, even the external remains of life: shells. Her few encounters with caring humans, especially Tate, changed it all: learning to read created the pathway that led to her success. Little did she know that others were quietly supporting her in small seemingly inconsequential ways as well, but the hateful treatment by many in the town is unbelievable except that it is. Shunning a child, making her life among them impossible for Kia goes on in others’ lives as well, and not everyone survives. I learned so much about nature in the marshes as well as exploring the depths of meanness possible in people.	
Maxine Wesley	5.0 out of 5 stars	July 21, 2019	Kindle Edition	You are never alone	Wonderful reading I envisioned every descriptive view of the marsh,shack, prison, trial,small town and each character. Although,  Kya was regrettably and consciously left alone, she really was never alone. Memories of brothers and sisters soon faded, but were imagined again because of an old family recording. Her relationship with the couple who gave gas, clothing and advice were reminiscent of not only what her father should have been but of people who cared for her.The marsh with its sand creatures, the shore and wind are all proof that she Kya was really never alone. And Of course, at 1st Tate was intrigued,thereby watching and loved her from afar.	
Kindle Customer	5.0 out of 5 stars	January 26, 2019	Kindle Edition	Wow!  Incredible. So moving and touching. Among the best books I've EVER read!	I don't even know what to write - seriously - I can really simply say - just buy it and read it - period. I think it would appeal to anyone, really. I'm a 57 year old man - father of 3 girls - been around a while - seen and experienced pleasant, and not so pleasant things. I'm, you might say, a rather hardened man - I'm fighting tears as I write this - it is THAT moving. I've read hundreds of books of all kinds - from literature to zombies, some good, some not so. I am amazed at this book.  Delia - whereever you are, whatever you are doing this minute - if its not writing another novel, you're wasting your time and talent. Please write more - lots more. Thank you so much for this experience.	
Patricia L. Nelson	5.0 out of 5 stars	November 17, 2018	Kindle Edition	Breathtaking...the words spill on the page take you hostage	Written so well it makes your heart ache with so many emotions. You long to stand next to Kya all the way through the novel never ever leaving her alone. I am retired and dealing with cancer and can read easily 4 books a month.  I can’t tell you the last book I have read that I couldn’t find something that seemed off, but not this book I never ever wanted it to end.  It is a must read all I can hope is that you find you way to take the time to read it...you will never be the same. All I can hope for now is for the author will write her second fiction novel and draw my right back into her incredible ability to make characters, towns and nature jump off the page.  This book will be bought by tinsel town and hopefully she will hold whatever rights she needs to make them stick to her vision.
